
In the quiet, dimly lit room, Harriet woke at the gentle rustle of pages t. her body feel still weird that the crushing weight of the splitting headache she had grown so accustomed to was now a distant memory, replaced by a peculiar sensation of lightness. she felt lighter than she ever been, she was so used growing up that her forehead was itching, that being free of that numbing sensation was awkward. she slowly opened her eyes to see the silhouette of Andromeda reading in the chair next to her bed. she looked up from her reading.
-"Good morning, Harriet," she spoke in a soft voice, gently placing the book on the small table beside the chair. "How are you feeling today?"
-Her throat was dry, the words sticking to it like parchment. "Better, I guess..." she murmured, her voice a mere echo of its usual strength. "My head... it doesn't hurt anymore." she tried to sit up on her bed.
Andromeda's eyes searched hers, a flicker of relief lighting up her features. "That's excellent news," she said, standing up with a grace that belied the urgency in her movements. She approached the bed, her robes whispering against the cold stone floor. "Let me help you sit up," she offered, placing a hand on Harriet's shoulder and adjusting the pillows behind her.

-"Before we proceed, I owe you an apology, Harriet," Andromeda began, her tone earnest and filled with sincerity. "My reaction last time was highly unprofessional, and utterly wrong. The truth is that your situation has left me... unsettled." She paused, gathering her thoughts. "I should have provided you with the support and information you needed from the start. I was afraid that speaking about it would make the reality of this... your situation too real for me to bear. But that's no excuse. You've done nothing to deserve the fear and confusion you've endured." She took a deep breath, her eyes searching for understanding in Harriet's gaze. "Will you accept my apology, and allow us to work together from here?"
Harriet felt an unsettling surge of emotion at the heartfelt apology. It was the first time she had encountered genuine empathy from someone, especially an adult, who seem sincere and care for her condition. 
-"Yeah, sure," Harriet offered a small smile. "I appreciate it."
Andromeda nodded, a hint of relief in her eyes. "It seems you've had another magical burst. When I arrived yesterday, Grimbold informed me you had exhausted yourself again. you have slept through the whole day, I'm glad to see you're feeling better," she said, her gaze lingering on the young witch with a mixture of concern and curiosity. "Grimbold told me they need to speak with you about it. Are you up to it?"
-"Sure, I don't mind" Harriet nodded slowly, still feeling the echoes of the magical energy that had coursed through her.
She left the room briefly, leaving behind the scent of mint and the faint sound of her footsteps. Upon her return, she carried a cup of fresh cut fruit and a small vial of clear potion. "Here," she said, setting them down on the table, "you should eat something before the meeting they'll come in half an hour."

Harriet nodded gratefully, her eyes lingering on the fruit. It looked so refreshing, yet she couldn't summon the usual feeling of hunger. She felt a strange lightness, a disconnect from the very concept of hunger. It had been almost a week since she'd had anything substantial, not since the ice cream she'd shared with Hagrid. But the very thought of food made her stomach twist in a peculiar way. "Thank you, Mrs. Tonks," she said politely, picking at a piece of fruit. She took a sip of the potion, feeling the cool liquid slide down her throat, a hint of mint and something else, something she couldn't quite place.
Her thoughts swirled around the odd sensation, a blend of wonder and fear at the changes happening within her.
-"I t's weird, I haven't eaten anything since Wednesday, yet I’m not hungry at all" she admitted softly, looking up at Andromeda with curiosity. "I've never felt like this before."

"It's because of the magic imbued in the bed, the goblin can weld wands, but they are good with runes" Andromeda explained, her tone a blend of gentle reassurance and the firmness of professionalism. "This is a quarantine room, designed to keep someone safe and healthy, even if they're carrying something contagious. without the need for someone to enter the room. The bed has been filling your stomach with a nutrition potion, and seeing to... other bodily needs," she said, with a touch of delicacy, "without you having to leave it. It's quite clever, really," she added with a small smile. "But Grimbold has informed me that your condition is stable enough for you to begin eating solid food again. Your body will need to readjust, but it's an encouraging sign." She paused, her gaze holding Harriet's for a moment longer than necessary.

-"I see," Harriet murmured, munching on the fresh fruit. She glanced at the book on runes that had been left by her side. "Could you tell me more about these?" she asked, her voice a tad stronger. "I've noticed some patterns on the bed, and I've been reading to pass the time."
Her eyes searched the pages, trying to find the runes she had recognized. "I think... I think I can see the ones that match the carvings here," she said, her voice gaining confidence as she pointed to the intricate designs etched into the bed's headboard. "But I'm not sure what they mean."
She felt a strange comfort in the familiar weight of the book, the smell of the ink and the paper, and the promise of knowledge hidden within its pages.
She reached out and traced one of the runes with her index finger, feeling a faint pulse of energy beneath her touch. "What does this one do?" she asked, pointing to a symbol that resembled a winding snake.
The runes looked ancient, yet somehow familiar, whispering secrets that tickled at the edge of her understanding. 
-"Ah, this one," Andromeda said, leaning closer to inspect the illustration. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she studied it. "It appears to be of a foreign origin. The goblins are known to integrate various forms of magical runes into their artifacts, even those beyond the understanding of most wizards and witches." She placed a gentle hand on the book, closing it gently. "But let's not get ahead of ourselves, Harriet. It's crucial that you focus on regaining your strength first. These matters are complex and best discussed when you're recovered. And I think you told me you never have the basic understanding of magic yet."
-"Ah, yes, I remember," Harriet said, her cheeks tinged with a hint of pink. She picked up the book again, her eyes scanning the pages with a newfound hunger for knowledge. "But it's just so... fascinating."
Her thoughts drifted to the diary entries she had read, her mother's delicate script explaining the intricacies of magic. It was like a door had been left ajar, revealing a world she was born into but never knew. It was a part of her, and she felt a strange yearning to understand it.
-"Ok. I guess," she promised, setting the book back down. "But I hope we can talk more about it soon." She took another sip of the potion, feeling a warmth spread through her veins as the minty taste gave way to something deeper, something that made her feel grounded.
Her eyes remained on Andromeda, seeking approval. "Thank you for the food and the apology," she whispered. "I'm just... I'm still trying to understand everything."
The older woman nodded solemnly, her gaze filled with understanding. "We'll take it one step at a time," she said, her hand briefly squeezing Harriet's. "But for now, let's prepare for your meeting with Grimbold. It's important that you get to the bottom of these incidents. The more you stay in Gringotts’s the riskier it is that someone pick up about you, and if the news spread you could get messy».
The room was quiet, the warmth of the potion began to spread throughout Harriet's body, and she felt a gentle tug of comfort, like a warm blanket being pulled around her shoulders. 

Andromeda sighed, her gaze returning to Harriet. "Your situation is... delicate, my dear. If the Ministry were to find out about a young witch trapped under Gringotts, it could indeed stir tensions between the wizarding world and the goblin nation. A war is the last thing we need." She paused, her expression growing more serious. "We are in a precarious position. The less people know, the safer everyone involved will be. But rest assured, we are doing all we can to ensure your well-being."
-"I understand," Harriet nodded, her eyes meeting Andromeda's. "I don't want to cause any trouble for anyone." She paused, her fingers playing with the edge of her blanket. "But what is so troublesome with me being here?"
Fear coiled around her heart like a serpent, whispering dark thoughts into her mind. The runes, the magic, it was all so alien and yet so intrinsic to her being. Could she ever truly be safe elsewhere, or would she always be a ticking time bomb? what if these... bursts, are a part of her? What if she can't control them?
Her voice was a mere thread of sound as she spoke, "What does it mean for me?" She swallowed hard, trying to push down the lump that had formed in her throat. "What does this all mean?"

-"I know you're feeling overwhelmed," Andromeda said, her voice filled with empathy. "But let's focus on the immediate. Grimbold will be here shortly, and he'll explain more about the magical implications. For now, just know that we are doing everything we can to protect you. And remember, you are under Gringotts' law, not the Ministry's." She offered a comforting smile, her hand resting gently on Harriet's.

A few minutes later Brodkrat, Grimbold and Gornuk entered Harriet room "miss potter, we are glad to see you well. healer Tonks could you wait outside please? if miss potter wish to share further information with you at future notice it's her choice but the subject is a national security concern for Gringotts’s."

A few minutes later, the heavy door to the chamber creaked open, and the silhouettes of Brodkrat, Grimbold, and Gornuk filled the space.
-"Miss Potter," Brodkrat began, holding the little carved box Harriet saw in the diary, his eyes flickering to Harriet. "We are indeed pleased to see that your condition has improved."
The goblins' expressions were stoic, their movements deliberate and precise. The tension in the room thickened, the air growing heavy with the weight of their presence.
-"Healer Tonks," Grimbold said to andromeda, his voice a gruff rumble, "we appreciate your care for Miss Potter, but we must ask that you step outside. The matters we wish to discuss are of the highest importance to the security of our nation. It is not our intent to cause any distress, but we must insist on privacy."
Andromeda's grip on Harriet's hand tightened briefly before she nodded and released her. "Of course," she said, her tone calm despite the concern etched on her face. "If you need me, I'll be just outside."
With a soft rustle of fabric, she left the room, closing the door behind her with a firm click. The three goblins approached the bed, their eyes never leaving Harriet's, as if they could see the secrets she held within her very soul.
In the dimly lit chamber, Brodkrat stood at the edge of the bed, his eyes scrutinizing Harriet with a gaze that seemed to bore into her very core. His hand tapped rhythmically against his knee, the sound echoing off the stone walls.
-"Miss Potter, we found in your vault the box you have been inquiry about, the magic imbued in it are no harm to Gringotts so your allowed to use it within our wall" he started, putting the box on the bedside table, his tone stern. "We need to discuss what happened two days ago. Your... outburst. It was unlike anything we have ever encountered before."
The room felt colder as the gravity of his words sank in. Harriet swallowed hard, her eyes darting to the runes on the headboard of the bed. The symbols seemed to pulse with an eerie glow, as if responding to the tension in the air.
-"I know," Harriet said, her voice small but steady. "I'm sorry for overreacting when he pointed that wand at me. It was... I didn't mean to cause any trouble." She paused, her eyes searching Brodkrat's for any sign of anger or understanding. "Could you tell curse-breaker Weasley that I'm sorry? I know he was just doing his job."
Her heart hammered in her chest as she awaited their response, the looming silence only serving to amplify her anxiety. She felt like a caged bird, desperately trying to flap its wings and find a way out.
-"What... what happens now?" she asked, her voice shaking slightly. "I don't want to put anyone else in danger. I just want to understand, to get better."
The goblins exchanged glances, their expressions unreadable.
Brodkrat's gaze softened, and he placed a gnarled hand on the bedpost. "Miss Potter," he said, his voice still firm but with a hint of reassurance. "We are not here to judge or punish you. The primary inquiry was to ensure that your concealed identity which considered an attempted theft, was indeed the result of your... circumstance. After careful examination and consultation with the best goblin healers, we have come to some preliminary conclusions."
Gornuk stepped forward, his eyes meeting Harriet's with an intensity that made her feel exposed. "Miss Potter," he said, his gruff voice filled with a newfound respect, "I must apologize for any distress my hasty actions may have caused. In reviewing the diary you provided, I've come to realize the depth of the one called flower's understanding of ancient magic. Her research into protection rituals was indeed remarkable."
He paused, his gaze flicking to the closed door behind which Andromeda waited. "She empowered an ancient ritual, one that was meant to protect you. it seems that that protection never stopped fighting against the taint. This is not a simple case of rogue magic, but rather an intricate web of ancient magic."

Gornuk spoke with a solemnity that resonated in the quiet chamber, his words heavy with the weight of ancient knowledge. "The Sol Ritual," he began, his eyes never leaving hers. "It's a ceremonial act that was once used by the most revered druids to safeguard their people during the harsh winter months. The essence of the ritual is the sacrifice of something meaning to the caster, which binds the protection to the recipient."
He paused, allowing the gravity of his revelation to sink in. "But the magic involved is untamed, a force that can backlash if not wielded correctly. It appears that flower, in her desperation to shield you, mixed it with something else she was researching..."
Brodkrat took over, his gaze unwavering. "Miss Potter, what we are about to share with you is a national secret for Gringotts, one that extends beyond the confines of our bank. We are entrusting you with this information because we believe that understanding it may be pivotal to your future, and potentially, to ours as well."
He leaned in, his hand resting on the bedpost with a gentle thump. "You must realize the gravity of the situation. We are prepared to share this knowledge without requiring an oath of secrecy, as we understand that withholding it may be detrimental to our collective future."
The goblin paused, his expression a mix of severity and concern. "Before we proceed, I want to emphasize the need for caution. This is not a tale for the faint of heart or the easily swayed. The knowledge we impart could shift the balance of power in ways we can't yet foresee."
The candles cast shadows that danced like silent sentinels across the cold stone floor, their flickering flames mirroring the tumultuous emotions playing out on Harriet's face.
-"I understand," Harriet said, her voice a whisper that seemed to float in the heavy silence. She nodded solemnly, her eyes never leaving Brodkrat's. "I won't tell anyone, I promise."
Her heart thudded in her chest like the drumbeat of an approaching storm, but she felt a strange calmness wash over her, a determination to face whatever secrets lay hidden in her mother's past.
-"Please, tell me everything," she urged, her voice steady despite the tremble of her hands. "I need to know. I have to understand why... why this is happening to me."
The goblins exchanged a knowing look, the gravity of the moment palpable in the air.
Gornuk's face grew stern, his eyes like two black embers in the candlelit room. "Before we delve into the situation," he began, "you must be aware of the context. There exists a forbidden dark ritual, one so heinous that even uttering its name requires the sanction of our highest authority."
He paused, allowing the implications to sink in, the air thickening with the weight of his words. "This ritual, Miss Potter, is used to create something known as a Horcrux." His voice dropped to a murmur, the syllables themselves seeming to crawl with ancient malice. "It requires the caster to commit an act so vile, so unforgivable, that it splits their soul, placing a fragment of it into an object - a receptacle. This act is one of the most feared and reviled practices in our history."
The room grew colder, the candles flickering as if in anticipation of the dark revelation to come. Gornuk leaned in closer, his eyes boring into Harriet's. "The creation of a Horcrux is not to be taken lightly. It is a grim and dangerous path, you need to understand that i's so wrong that is infect the very fabric of our world and spread its influence around it. someone under its field of influence for a long time would slowly become the worst version of oneself."
The three goblins watched her, their faces a tableau of solemnity, as if waiting for her to crumble under the weight of their words. But Harriet held their gazes, her own eyes flashing with a newfound resolve. she started to fear what Gornuk was about to say but she stood strong waiting for the full explanation.
Gornuk's gaze remained unyielding. "I believe that the late Flower, was researching a way to counteract this dark magic. Perhaps she sought to destroy a Horcrux, or to protect you from its influence. Her notes suggest a deep understanding of soul magic, something that is almost unheard of in our time."
He paused, allowing the gravity of his words to settle before continuing. "It is my hypothesis, one not yet fully supported by evidence, that she developed an entirely new form of protection using her own soul as a sacrifice. A magic so potent, it has bound itself to you, she you feel threatened, and you feel need to protect yourself, it would manifest in these unpredictable bursts."
At this revelation, even the stoic faces of Brodkrat and Grimbold betrayed their astonishment. The room remained still, the only sound the faint crackle of the candle flames as they danced in the sudden draft.
-"Her intentions were noble," Gornuk added, his voice softer now. "But the consequences of meddling with such ancient and powerful forces are unpredictable. The magic she wove into the Sol Rune is untamed, a raw power that you now carry within you."
The goblins watched her intently, their expressions a mix of awe and concern. It was clear that they had never encountered anything quite like this before, and the implications were as vast as they were terrifying.
-"Miss Potter," Gornuk spoke with gravity, "according to the rumours, you survived a dark spell cast on the fateful night of October 31, 1981. A night when your parents, James and Lily Potter, were tragically taken from you."
His eyes bore into hers, searching for a flicker of understanding. "We believe that your mother, knowing the extent of the danger, invoked the Sol Rune. A selfless act that likely cost her life but empowered the rune to protect you in ways we are only beginning to fathom."
He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a murmur that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the chamber. "When the Dark one attempted to end your life, the protection within you, fuelled by Flower's love and sacrifice, recoiled. A fragment of his soul, must have been seeking refuge, tried to latch onto you. But the rune protected you from possession."
The room grew still, the air thick with the tension of unspoken fears. "The rune," Gornuk continued, "now resides within you, a beacon of protection that activates whenever you feel threatened."
The goblins exchanged glances, the weight of their words hanging in the air like a dark shroud. "The magic is unstable, and we must tread carefully. But know this, Miss Potter, the protection you bear is a testament to your mother's love and strength."
Gornuk's face remained as serious as the words he spoke. "Still, along my hypothesis, at some point near those events, someone meddled with your very essence, using your inherent Metamorphomagus ability and something akin to a stasis charm to stabilize your magical core and prevent it from reverting to your original identity. But as a side effect, it stabilized the rune, preventing it to push back the taint of the Dark Lord's magic."
He paused, his expression thoughtful as he considered the complex web of magic that had been spun around her. "This interference is what has allowed you to live a life hidden from the one who sought your destruction, but it has also kept the rune dormant within you."

Grimbold took over, his eyes reflecting the candlelight. "When you passed through the waterfall on the night of the 31st of October, something happened. The magic of the water, potent and ancient, dissolved the enchantments that concealed your true identity."
He paused, his gaze intense. "This act released the stasis on your magical core and allowed the rune to resume its battle against the taint. It explains the intense headaches you've been experiencing—what we thought was residual after effect of your Metamorphomagus ability unstabilising your core was the rune's efforts to fight the taint."
He leaned in slightly, his expression earnest. "Can you tell us, Miss Potter, if something significant occurred on the 3rd of August that might have triggered a change? Perhaps a moment of intense emotion or event helping the rune to regain its strength and push back the taint?"
The goblins waited, their eyes never leaving hers, the candlelight casting a warm glow across their stern faces. The shadows in the room grew still, as if the very stones themselves held their breath in anticipation of her response.
-“I... I don't know," Harriet's voice wavered, her eyes searching the faces of the goblins. "But I remember finding this diary, it was...There was something about it, something that felt...right."
Her cheeks flushed as she recalled the intimate moments shared between her mother, Flower, and her friends, Cassandra and Caroll. The way they spoke of the ancient rituals, their fear and hope etched into the very fabric of the parchment.
And then, she remembered the letter at the end, the one addressed to 'Blossom'. 
Grimbold's expression softened, his gruff voice carrying a gentle note of encouragement. "Miss Potter, the information you provide could be invaluable in our ongoing struggle against the Dark One. Your mother's research, her creation of the Sol Rune, and the protection it offers, could be a beacon of hope in these dire times."
He paused, allowing the words to sink in before continuing. "The diary, your mother's words, and the symbol that lies within it...it's all part of a puzzle, one that, when solved, may hold the key to counteracting the dark magic that still threatens our world. We need your help to piece it together."
The gravity of his request hung in the air, a silent plea that resonated through the chamber. The goblins watched her, their expressions a tapestry of hope and urgency. The flickering candlelight cast shadows across the room, dancing across the ancient runes etched into the walls, as if echoing the rhythm of the unspoken promise that lay between them.
With trembling hands, Harriet reached for the diary that had become a lifeline in her quest for understanding. She carefully extracted the letter from its pages, the parchment feeling like a piece of her very soul. "Here," she whispered, offering it to Brodkrat. "This was the first time I knew...I felt loved."
Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as she watched him take it, her voice filled with a mix of pain and hope. "Please, be careful, it's the only words I have from here."
The goblin's hand closed over the letter with surprising gentleness, his eyes never leaving hers as he nodded solemnly. "We will," he promised, his voice a rumble of assurance. all three goblin frowned at the idea of this young one was never felt loved before.

Gornuk, Grimbold, and Brodkrat took the letter with a sense of reverence that was palpable in the stillness of the medical chamber. They studied it closely, their eyes scanning the delicate script with a mix of awe and solemnity. As they read, their expressions grew grave, the gravity of the revelation sinking in.

Gornuk, Grimbold, and Brodkrat took the letter with a sense of reverence that was palpable in the stillness of the medical chamber. They studied it closely, their eyes scanning the delicate script with a mix of awe and solemnity. As they read, their expressions grew grave, the gravity of the revelation sinking in.
When they had finished, they each bowed their heads slightly, the candlelight casting a solemn glow on their faces. "We recognize the might of the great warrior Lily Evans-Potter," Brodkrat said, his voice thick with respect. "Her actions, her dedication to fighting the Dark, to seeking the truth, and her unyielding will to keep fighting, even through the veil of death. must here name be remembered forever in Gringotts’s as the unyielding flower."
Harriet felt a warmth spread through her chest at Brodkrat's words. she felt proud. not for herself. but those 3 goblins, they weren't like the wizards that mobed her when she got in the leaky cauldron the first time with Hagrid, all talking about the boy-who-lived without knowing what really happened. those know even better than herself what her mom did to protect her, and they were respectfully bowing their head and called her a great warrior. she bowed her head too "Thank you," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. "For recognizing her, for understanding. You do here a great honour"
The goblins looked at her with a mix of awe and concern. "Miss Potter," Gornuk spoke, his tone gentle, "You carry the legacy of a great witch, one who loved you so fiercely that she gave her very soul to protect you."
As Grimbold took over the conversation, his gaze remained steadfast on Harriet, his voice echoing the seriousness of the revelation. "The magic that your mother, Flower, invoked is as ancient and intricate as the very fabric of our world. The Sol Rune, a symbol of purity and protection, became a part of you, bound by the intent and love of your mother. Whenever you felt threatened or feared for your safety, the rune would activate."
He paused, allowing her to absorb the gravity of his words. "This is no mere artifact, flower's daughter. It is a living testament to the power of maternal love and sacrifice. It's why the rune reacts to your emotions, especially strong one to strengthen its protective wards. It's why, when you felt the warmth of belonging, the rune's power grew stronger, and the dark essence was forced to recede."
The candle's flame danced in his eyes, casting an eerie shadow across the room, yet the warmth in his voice remained constant. "But beware," he added, his tone shifting to one of caution. "This magic is not to be taken lightly. It is raw and untamed, we don't know what effect it could have. "
Gornuk nodded in agreement, his eyes gleaming with a mix of admiration and concern. "Indeed, flower's daughter," he began, his voice a low rumble in the quiet chamber. "But thanks to that power and the curse-breaker Weasley's little stunt," the goblin chuckled, his expression a rare mix of amusement and respect, "you have fully activated the Sol Rune within you, completely banishing the taint of the Dark One's magic. We no longer need to fear for those around you being influenced by its dark whispers."
The air in the room grew heavier with the weight of their words, the shadows on the walls seeming to hold their breath as the implications of their revelations settled over them. The candles flickered, casting a warm glow on the ancient runes that lined the stone walls, as if in silent affirmation of the truth that had been spoken.
-"Now," Gornuk continued, his tone growing firmer, "with the taint vanquished, the rune's power lies solely within your control. It is a gift from your mother, to be wielded wisely and with great care."

Grimbold cleared his throat, bringing the conversation back to the immediate concerns of Harriet's health. "Your magical core is rapidly stabilizing, flower's daughter," he said, his gruff voice filled with a surprising tenderness. "The potions we've been giving you have worked their magic, and your Metamorphomagus ability seems to be calming down as well. We expect you to be able to walk without much trouble tomorrow, with some assistance, of course."
He paused, his gaze lingering on her for a moment, the candlelight playing across the lines of his face, which had softened slightly. "In a few days, your strength and magical reserves should return to their full wizarding capacity. The potions we've administered will ensure that your body and magic are restored to their rightful balance."

Brodkrat stepped forward, his hand resting gently on Harriet's shoulder. "We have much to discuss regarding the future," he said, his voice low and solemn. "But for now, we believe it's best that you rest and allow your body and mind to recover from the ordeal you've been through. The diary, your mother's research, and the bond between you and the Sol Rune are matters of great importance that you must address with clear head."
The goblin's eyes searched hers, his gaze holding a promise of protection and guidance. "Rest now, flower's daughter," he urged, his voice a gentle rumble. "We will speak more of these matters when you are stronger. For now, let the ancient stones of Gringotts be your sanctuary, and may the warmth of the candlelight and the whispers of the gold in our vaults soothe you into peaceful slumber."
With that, the three goblins turned to leave, letting andromeda coming back.
As the goblins filed out, Andromeda approached the bedside, her eyes filled with gentle concern. "That must have been quite a serious talk, usually seeing three goblins walking like that mean lot of trouble," she murmured, her hand resting lightly on Harriet's forearm. "How are you feeling?"
-"Thank you," Harriet replied, her voice a soft whisper that seemed to resonate with the gravity of the goblins' words. She looked up at Andromeda, her eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight. "They said I should be in full health in a few days, and that I'm...free of charge regarding the attempting thief thing. I'm just trying to process everything."
Her gaze drifted to the diary on the bedside table, the leather worn but the pages within brimming with secrets. "I've been carrying this burden," she continued, her voice tightening with emotion. "All the weird thing that seen to happen to me or why they happen, I don't even understand."
Her eyes searched Andromeda's, looking for a spark of understanding or reassurance. "But they think...my mother, she did something to protect me, something powerful and ancient. And now, it's all tied up with this...this rune on my forehead."
Andromeda nodded, her expression a blend of sympathy and determination. "Harriet, if you're feeling up to it, I can tell you the story that's been passed around about the boy-who-lived," she offered, her tone measured. "Everyone has their version, but it's something you should know, especially given what you've just learned about your mother's protection. Or, if it's too much, we can save it for later."
Harriet took a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable. "No," she said, with a firmness that seemed to surprise even herself. "I need to know. And if it's going to help me understand...I want to know."
Her eyes searched Andromeda's. "Please, tell me," she urged, her voice barely above a whisper. "I need to understand the person they've made me into, the story that's been told about me. I can't keep running from it."
She felt a knot in her stomach tighten. She clutched the diary to her chest, the warm leather a comforting presence against her skin. It was as if the book itself was the only thing that have been real for her since she heard about magic. The diary and the rune were her legacy, a testament to her mother's love and sacrifice. And with that knowledge came a responsibility she hadn't asked for but couldn't ignore.
The candles cast a warm, wavering glow across the medical chamber, the shadows playing across the ancient runes on the wall seeming to pulse with a life of their own, as if in anticipation of the revelations to come.
