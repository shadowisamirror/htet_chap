
Andromeda's gaze was filled with understanding as she began to speak. "Harriet, I don't really know your past, or how do you feel about it, remember it's what people have been saying not what I think about it so don't curse the messenger, okay? On the night of October 31st to November 1st, something remarkable happened. They say that the you-know-who, attempted to end the bloodline of the Potters. The spell he cast, the Killing Curse, should have taken your life, but instead it bounced back, destroying him." She paused, allowing the gravity of her words to sink in. "Nobody truly knows how it happened, but the whispers grew, and soon everyone was speaking of the boy-who-lived. The war ended that night, and the wizarding world believed in hope again."
"I know that much," Harriet said, her voice low and measured. "But what I don't understand,"
Harriet nodded slowly, her eyes never leaving Andromeda's. "That's what Hagrid told me too. But he was to gentle to tell me more. What's the Killing Curse?" she murmured, the words feeling like a weight on her tongue. 
Her thoughts raced, trying to piece together the puzzle of her own story. Her gaze drifted back to the diary,
"The Killing Curse, Harriet," Andromeda's voice was soft yet firm, "is one of the three Unforgivable Curses," she said, enunciating each syllable as if they were the most dangerous words in the world. "They're called that because they're so vile, so powerful, that using them earns you a life sentence in Azkaban. The three curses consisted of the Killing Curse, Avada Kedavra, the other two are, the Cruciatus Curse, Crucio," she shivered at the mere mention of the torture curse, "and the Imperius Curse, Imperio, which controls the mind. These curses are not to be taken lightly, they are not to be used for fun or spite. They're the darkest of dark magic." She squeezed Harriet's hand trying to comfort her despite her own shivers. 
Harriet's eyes widened as she processed the gravity of Andromeda's words with a furrowed brow. "I see," she whispered, her fingertips tracing the worn edges of the diary. these curses, why would she be searching for such dark magic. Harriet felt the weight of her mother's secrets.
Her stomach twisted into a knot of anxiety. Her gaze returned to the diary, the leather warm against her skin. It was the only tangible connection she had to her mother, the only way to understand the woman who had loved her enough to give her life.

As Harriet remained silent, Andromeda took a deep breath, her eyes filled with gentle understanding. "Now, enough of this heavy talk for now," she said, her tone lightening as she reached into her handbag, pulling out a bundle of clothes. " I brought you something that might make you feel a bit more like yourself… can’t have you lounging around in a hospital gown forever," she added with a smile, revealing a bundle of fabric that had once been Nymphadora's. "These were Nymphie's, she outgrew them, I thought they might fit you. They're a bit...unique," she said, her smile growing as she laid them on the bed.
A shiver of dread had run down Harriet's spine at the mention of girls' clothing. Since discovering the truth about her gender, she had done her best to avoid the reality, focusing instead on the more immediate issues of survival and understanding her newfound magical abilities. However, with the situation regarding the rune and the dark magic's taint now resolved, she knew she could no longer ignore this part of her identity. As she took in the sight of the t-shirt and jeans that Andromeda had brought, she felt a sense of relief wash over her. They were simple, comfortable, and even a little bit cool - a stark contrast to the oversized hand-me-downs from her cousin. She reached out tentatively, her fingers brushing against the fabric, feeling a strange mix of excitement and apprehension. "Thank you," she murmured, her voice laced with gratitude. "I've... I've never had anything like this before."
Her eyes searched Andromeda's, looking for a sign of judgment or pity, but finding only warmth and acceptance. It was a stark reminder of the stark contrast between the families she had known - the cold, unforgiving Dursleys and the welcoming, if slightly overwhelming, world of wizards and magic. She took a deep breath and made a silent vow to herself to not reject this new part of her identity, no matter how uncomfortable it may be. After all, she was not Harry Potter, the boy who lived; she was Harriet Potter, flower's daughter, the girl with a legacy of love and sacrifice to uphold.
Taking the clothes into her hands. She examined the t-shirt with the drawing of a badass on a broom and the words "Holyhead Harpies" emblazoned across it. Her gaze drifted to the other t-shirt with the handwritten "I'm a Metaphor-Magus" scribbled across the front. She couldn't help but chuckle at the playfulness of it. It was a stark contrast to the gravity of the conversations they'd been having, and she needed that lightness. "I'm not sure what that means," she admitted, looking back up at Andromeda with curiosity. "But it sounds like something my mother would have liked."
Her heart felt lighter as she spoke, a burgeoning sense of belonging growing within her. These simple gestures, the sharing of clothes and stories, were the threads that began to weave a new tapestry of her identity. And while the path ahead was fraught with challenges, she knew that she was not alone in this journey.
Andromeda watched as the warmth of her smile reflected in Harriet's eyes. "You're welcome, dear," she said, her voice filled with genuine warmth. "But remember, we do need to have a chat about... well, about being a young witch before you're up and about." She paused, her gaze softening as she added, "It's important to be prepared, especially with everything you're going through."
Harriet nodded solemnly, her hands still wrapped around the bundle of clothes. "I know," she said, her voice steady despite the turmoil of emotions within her. "But maybe...not today, please?" Her eyes searched Andromeda's for any sign of disappointment or frustration, but all she found was patience and understanding. It was a stark reminder of the stark contrast between the cold, unforgiving world of the Dursleys and the welcoming embrace of the wizarding world. "I just...I need some time to...process," she continued, her voice a whisper. "This is all so much to take in. I've spent my life as Harry, and now..." She took a deep breath, her eyes filling with tears she hadn't known she'd been holding back. "Now, I'm Harriet, with all this..." She waved the t-shirt, the symbol of her new identity. "And I want to be her, I really do, but it's..."
The words caught in her throat, and she took a moment to compose herself. "Thank you for being here," she finally managed, her voice thick with emotion. "For understanding."
The room was quiet for a moment. Andromeda stepped closer, her hand reaching out to gently pat Harriet's shoulder. "Take all the time you need, love," she said. "We're all here for you."
The moment of quiet contemplation was abruptly shattered by the sound of the heavy oak door creaking open. In strode Graglast, the potter's account steward, his stern expression unwavering as he held a thick, leather-bound folder in his hand. The candlelight danced off the metallic buckles that adorned the folder, casting a series of flickering shadows across the ancient runes etched into the walls of the chamber. "Miss Potter," he said, his voice gruff and unyielding. "You have delayed your duties for long enough. We must discuss your assets and the implications of your recent... mishandling."

At the sound of Graglast's gruff voice, Harriet startled, her eyes darting to the doorway. She felt a flash of anger, her hand tightening around the diary and the shirt. How dare he interrupt such a private moment? But before she could react, she felt Andromeda's hand on her forearm. She took a deep breath, the warmth of Andromeda's touch grounding her.
As the goblin entered the room, Andromeda noticed the shift in Harriet's magic and placed her hand gently on her shoulder, offering a calming presence. "Thank you for the urgent reminder," she said, her tone firm yet respectful. "Miss Potter will review her assets at her earliest convenience, once her health allows it." She met the goblin's gaze, her eyes unyielding, a silent message of protection for Harriet conveyed.
Graglast's stern gaze lingered on the two of them for a moment longer, his eyes narrowing before he throws the leather-bound folder onto the bed with a thud that echoed through the chamber. The candlelight glinted off the buckles, the room's ambiance tense and thick with unspoken words. He nodded curtly, his expression belying his frustration. He turned on his heel and strode out of the room, the door thudding shut behind him. The air felt heavier with his departure, the unspoken tension lingering like a chill in the air.
"What was that about?!" Harriet's voice a mix of anger and incredulity. She glanced down at the folder, the cold leather feeling like a rebuke against her palms. "Andromeda, why would he talk to me like that? I've just discovered who I am, and he expects me to dive into this..." She trailed off, gesturing to the folder with a tremble in her hand. The anger was a shield, hiding the fear of the unknown that lay ahead.
Andromeda's eyes searched Harriet's, the intensity of her gaze mirroring the gravity of the situation. "I'm sorry if I overstepped, but you need to know how to handle these situations, especially in a place like Gringotts. From my experience, when someone in authority speaks to you like that, it's usually for one of three reasons: they're testing you, they're genuinely upset, or they're hiding something." She paused, her gaze intense. "As your healer and confidant, it's my duty to guide you through this. Remember, Harry, no matter what, never let anyone—be it wizard or goblin—make you feel less than you are. You are the heir to a powerful legacy, and you do not bend to their will. If something feels amiss, trust your instincts. Grab your things and leave. Do you understand?" Her eyes searched Harry's, looking for signs of comprehension. "Your well-being is of the utmost importance, and I don't want you to face such interactions alone."
Looking at Andromeda with a mix of defiance and understanding, Harry nodded firmly. "If he was just testing me, then he's not much of a steward," she murmured, her voice laced with the kind of quiet strength that comes from knowing she has survived so much. "But if he's really upset or trying to deceive me..." Her voice trailed off, the unspoken words hanging in the air like an uncast spell. The fire in her eyes spoke volumes, a silent declaration of her intent to stand her ground. "Either way, I'm not going to let him push me around. I'll find out the truth and make him regret it if he's crossed a line." Her fists clenched around the folder.
"Thank you, Andromeda," Harriet said, her voice steady despite the tremble in her hand. She took a deep breath and slipped into the jeans and t-shirt, putting it over her hospital gown to not have to see her own intimacy. "I know I need to face this, but I'm not ready to deal with his games today." She glanced at the folder, her eyes narrowing. "First, we need to talk to someone who actually knows what's going on around here. Someone who won't play games with me."
Her gaze hardened as she buttoned the jeans. "I want to talk to Brodkrat. He seems more... straight-forward." She stepped away from the bed awkwardly, after not using her legs for a week felt weird. 
Andromeda sighed, a gentle sound that spoke volumes of her empathy. She offered her arm to Harriet, the gesture a silent promise of support. "Let me help you," she said, her voice a soothing balm in the tension-filled room.
As they stepped out of the room, the cool stone corridors of Gringotts stretched out before them. Spotting the goblin nurse who had tended to her when Andromeda wasn't around, she called out, "Excuse me, could you tell me where Inquisitor Brodkrat office is?" The goblin paused in her task, her beady eyes assessing Harriet's new attire before nodding curtly and pointing down the corridor. "Follow the left turn, third door on the right."
Her eyes never left the goblin nurse's, the intensity of her stare a silent question. The nurse met her gaze, something akin to admiration flickering in her eyes before she returned to her duties. Harriet felt a strange kinship with the goblin nurse.
Harriet, with Andromeda by her side, heads down the corridor, her feet on the ground as she tries to balance her weight with her unsteady legs. The candlelight flickers, casting shadows that dance along the walls.
Upon reaching the massive double door with 'Inquisitor Brodkrat' inscribed on a golden plate, Harriet takes a deep breath and knocks twice. The echo of her knocks reverberated through the silent hallway, and she waited, her grip on the folder tight, feeling the leather creak under the pressure of her clenched hand. 
The moment the sound of knocking pierced the silence, the door to Brodkrat's office swung open with a creak that seemed to carry the weight of centuries. The goblin looked up from his ledger, one eyebrow arched in curiosity. His eyes took in the sight of Harriet and Andromeda, the former's legs wobbly with newfound strength and the latter's expression a mask of steely resolve. "Flower's daughter," he said, his voice a low rumble that filled the space, "I leave you for but an hour and you're already sniffing around for me," the sarcasm thick in his tone. "What new conundrum do you wish to lay at my feet?" His tone was teasing, but the glint in his eye was sharp as the sword.
The office was a stark contrast to the clinical chamber they'd just left. It was laden with ancient tomes, scrolls, and artifacts that whispered secrets of the goblin world. The scent of ink and aged parchment filled the air, mingling with the faint scent of metal from the various goblin-made trinkets scattered across the mahogany desk. The walls were adorned with intricate tapestries depicting battles long past and agreements made in blood.
She steps into the room, her eyes scanning the ancient tomes and artifacts with a mix of awe and wariness. "I just thought you missed me," she adds with a slight smirk, trying to lighten the mood before the gravity of the situation descends once more. She walks closer to the desk, leaning slightly on it for support, the folder of her assets feeling like a burden she's eager to shed. "I want to understand what's happening with my accounts, and why Graglast is acting so... strange towards me." She keeps her gaze steady.
Brodkrat's gaze sharpened at her words, his eyes narrowing as he studied her with a keen sense of scrutiny. The torch on the wall flickered with the unspoken tension in the air, casting a dance of shadows across the heavy tomes. His frown grew deeper as he took in her unsteady stance, the folder clutched in her hand. "Flower's daughter," he said, his voice a measured thunder, "I would advise you to tread carefully with accusations. However, I suspect you have come for more than a mere accounting." His hand reached out, palm up, gesturing for the folder she held so tightly. "Let us examine this together, shall we?" His eyes never left hers, the unspoken challenge in his gaze a silent promise to stand with her in the face of any adversity.
Harriet hesitates for a moment, then places the folder into Brodkrat's outstretched hand. She straightens up, her eyes never leaving his, and speaks with a firmness that belies her trembling voice. "To be honest, the walk here helped me calm down and think. I didn't come here to complain, I came because Andromeda stopped another magic burst when Graglast stormed into my room, barking at me. His behaviour was suspicious, and I realized that I know as much about goblin culture as I do about the wizarding world. So, I've come for guidance, and to get a fair perspective on what's happening with my accounts." 
Brodkrat took the folder, his eyes scanning the documents with a practiced ease. His expression serious as he turned the pages. He closed it after a few moments and looked at her, his gaze piercing through the gloom of the office. "Flower's daughter, it seems there are indeed... irregularities within this file," he said, his tone echoing the gravity of the situation. "Your assets are not just numbers in a ledger, they are a testament to your lineage... If you wish, we can file an official grievance but beware that such actions can stir the cauldron of buried truth." He paused, his gaze searching her face for any signs of doubt or fear. "But before we proceed, I must ask, are you prepared for what this could entail?" His eyes glinted with a mix of concern and determination. 
She nods firmly, the candlelight reflecting off her glasses and casting a soft glow across her face. "I've had enough of secrets and lies, inquisitor Brodkrat. I've lived through an explosion of my own magic, and I'm standing here, aren't I?" Her voice holds a steely resolve that resonates in the room. "Whatever truths are buried, I'm ready to unearth them. I need to understand it all. This," she taps the folder, "this is my life, and I won't be kept in the dark any longer." She pauses, then adds, "And if it stirs up trouble, so be it. I'll face it." The fire in her eyes is unmistakable, a mirror of the fiery determination that had once burned so brightly in her mother's gaze.
Brodkrat nodded slowly, his eyes never leaving hers. "Very well, flower's daughter," he said, his voice filled with a weary resignation. "I shall come to see you on the morrow to discuss the initial findings of my investigation. But for now," he gestured to the door with a hint of impatience, "I would ask that you leave. please leave now before you add another load of work to my plate.”
"Of course, Inquisitor Brodkrat," she says, she glances at Andromeda, who offered arm to help to walk outside, before turning back to the goblin. "Thank you for your time. And," she adds, a hint of mischief glinting in her eyes, "don't work too hard. I wouldn't want you to miss me too much." With that, she takes a tentative step away from the desk, leaning heavily on Andromeda's arm as she exits the office.
"Like a sore thumb," Brodkrat choked under his breath, his smirk widening slightly as he watched them leave. The smirk on Harriet and brodkrat face send shiver down Andromeda's spine, despite the warmth of the room. The goblin's gaze remained on the closed door, contemplating the gravity of the situation. The air thickened with the unspoken understanding that the path ahead was fraught with danger and secrets, and that their alliance would be tested. As they walked away, the flickering torches cast long shadows behind them, stretching out like fingers reaching for the hidden truths they sought.
Once they were a safe distance from Brodkrat's office, Andromeda couldn't help but voice her concern, her eyes reflecting the flickering torchlight. "Harriet, I know you're strong and determined, but speaking to an inquisitor like that can be risky. Remember, we're in their world here. Their laws are not ours." She looks down at her, a gentle hand on her shoulder. "You must always be mindful of the currents you stir in the waters of Gringotts. It's a place of power, and not everyone has your best interests at heart." Her voice is soft, but the warning is clear.
Harriet nods at Andromeda's words, her eyes never leaving the path ahead as they walk down the dimly lit corridor. "I know, Andromeda. I'm not a fool to underestimate the gravity of what's happening here." She pauses, "But if it comes to it, I trust Brodkrat. He's straightforward, and he seems genuinely concerned for my welfare." She looks up at Andromeda, her expression a mix of resolve and trepidation. "I don't trust every goblin, but right now, I'd choose him over any wizard who tries to manipulate me with their own agendas." The echo of their footsteps is the only sound in the tense silence that follows.
As they reach the infirmary, Andromeda takes a moment to consider her word. "Harriet. Brodkrat is an honest goblin, but we mustn't forget the ways of his kind. Goblins value gold and treasure above all else, their loyalty can be fierce, but their sense of justice... it's not always aligned with ours." She sighs, her eyes filled with a knowing sadness. She helps Harriet back into bed, tucking the covers around her gently. 
She took the diary on her bedside table and clutches it tightly to her chest. she took a deep breast to not leash at andromeda, but she needed to make her point across "andromeda I really appreciate you help and advice really, and I hope with time I can trust you fully... but you need to understand brodkrat already earned that trust, I was unconscious at his mercy, he could have, and by his own law, should have sentenced me to the worst punishment they have.. without knowing me he helped me, he gave me a way to stand my ground, something that no wizard ever done. I don't know what happened when my parents died... but if like you said the wizarding world have me in such high regard they could have helped me to not rot with my relative, in a body that wasn't mine... you told me yourself having me in Gringotts could bring so much trouble to them and yet I could waltz it Brodkrat office without appointment and just give him the folder.. I’m not naive enough to think there is nothing for them in return, I know they see it like some kind of investment, yet again they put no strings on me... "
Andromeda nods slowly, understanding the weight of Harriet's words. "You're right," she says, her voice tinged with a hint of sadness. "I have no right to force you to trust me, nor to judge the bonds you form here. I merely wish to guide you." She strokes Harriet's hair softly, her eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight. 
"Thank you, Andromeda," Harriet says with a small smile, "I appreciate your concern. But I need to find my own path in this new world. Maybe we could just study a bit today and you could explain to me the wizard side of things? If I have to go to Hogwarts, it's better if I know how to handle wizard... niceties," she says with a hint of sarcasm, "without making a blunder." 
"Of course, Harriet," Andromeda responds with a gentle smile, her voice filled with the warmth of candlelit comfort. She moves to the large stack of books on Harriet bedside table, her eyes scanning the ancient tomes. "We'll start with the basics," she says.

The rest of the day unfolds in a soft symphony of rustling pages and whispered explanations. Andromeda and Harriet delve into the intricacies of spells, potions, and the unspoken etiquette of wizard culture. Each spell they discussed is met with a spark of curiosity and a sprinkle of wonder. The glow of the candles dance across their faces as the hours slip by, each minute a testament to their growing bond.
The grandeur of the infirmary, with its arched ceilings and ancient tapestries, becomes a cocoon of knowledge and understanding. Outside, the bustle of Gringotts fades to a distant murmur, allowing them to focus on the task at hand. Andromeda, with the patience of a mother hen, explains the nuances of the wizarding world with such clarity that even the most complex of concepts seem to melt away like shadows in the dawn. Harriet, eager to learn, listens intently, her eyes widening with every new revelation. The air in the room is thick with the scent of dusty tomes and the promise of uncharted adventures, as the pages of her past give way to the unwritten chapters of her future.
