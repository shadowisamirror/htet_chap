Harriet heard the short gasp coming from the goblin who came to check on her and instantly run back. The sudden commotion beyond the confines of her hospital room snapped Harriet out of the fitful sleep she had been attempting to maintain. She sat up with a sharp intake of breath, the fabric of her hospital gown whispering against the damp sheets. Her forehead felt like it was on fire, the heat of fever pulsating in time with her racing heartbeat. Her eyes searched the shadows, her hand reaching out for her glasses on the bedside table. Why is the goblin nurse so alarmed? Is something wrong? she reached for the rune burning on her forehead and found out it was leaking black goo.

The heavy silence that followed was broken by the rapid patter of goblin feet, growing louder as they approached. The door to her chamber swung open with a creak that echoed off the cold stone walls. Goblin doctor Grimbold burst through, his eyes wide with alarm and his robes looking as though he had been roused from a deep sleep. The goblin nurse with a stern face, followed closely behind, her movements swift and precise as she approached the bed and cleaned Harriet forehead with a clean cloth. Grimbold started to run test over her with a crystal, as the nurse was cleaning the black substance oozing from the rune on Harriet's forehead. With a clean cloth. ""Miss Potter, please remain calm," Grimbold instructed, his voice tight with tension. "We need to perform some additional tests. How do you feel miss potter?" 

Grimbold's gaze was unwavering as he spoke, "We've been observing the rune's reaction to the unbinding of your magic. It appears that the taint within it is not content to simply remain dormant. The rune is actively fighting back, and the process is... unpredictable. Our scholars are working tirelessly to understand the full extent of what is happening. But for now, we must be vigilant." He paused, the air thick with anticipation. "The black substance you see is a byproduct of this battle. It is a sign that your body is trying to purge the corruption. The rune, however, seems to be fighting anew. Your condition is... delicate. We need to proceed with caution." He replaced the crystal lens to his eye and leaned closer to her forehead, the light reflecting off the intricate metal frame.

"But would it help to...?" Harriet's voice trailed off as she reached for the leather-bound diary her mother had been using to research the mysterious rune etched upon her forehead. She flipped open the pages, her trembling fingers finding the spot where she had meticulously noted down her mother's handwriting. The candlelight danced across the parchment, casting eerie shadows on the wall. "My mother wrote about its power, about how it's used to protect the soul. Could this be connected to... what's happening?" She offered the diary to Grimbold, hope flickering in her eyes despite the fear that clawed at her from the inside.

Grimbold's eyes narrowed slightly as he took the diary with a gentle nod, his grip firm but careful. "Your mother's insights could indeed be invaluable. With your permission, we would like to study this further." He paused, his gaze lingering on the diary, a silent understanding passing between them. "In exchange," he continued, his voice softer, "Gringotts’s would be honoured to create a perfect copy for you, ensuring that your mother's work remains with you, as well as the box you inquired about yesterday." The goblin's expression was sincere, a rare sight in the stoic creature's countenance. "This way, you can keep the original with you, and we can delve deeper into the diary's secrets without risking its integrity."


"Thank you, Grimbold," she murmured, her eyes never leaving the diary for too long. The thought of losing such a precious piece of her mother's life was too much to bear. "I'll trust in your discretion," she added, handing over the diary with a sigh. As he turned to leave with the soiled cloth and diary in hand, she lay back down on the bed, her mind racing with a newfound purpose. The rune burning on her head, but she pushed them aside, focusing instead on her mother's words. "I'm not alone," she murmured to herself. "I never was."


The room was bathed in the soft glow of candlelight, the shadows playing upon the ancient stone walls. The silence was pierced only by the distant sound of goblin whispers, the hushed tones hinting at the urgency of the situation.
Harriet lay on the bed trying to relax, she had learned long time ago that, clearing her mind was helping to push out the pain when she had broken bones our to push out the hunger when she was starving in her cupboard. focusing on her mind rather than her boding she was musing about everything that happened to her the piece of information the diary has provided, for the first time of her life she had a purpose. people have been wronged her, that was obvious, but it seems it's started even before her parent death. thinking about it made her realise she can do it alone, she need people she can trust, but she don't know anyone, she would have to follow the leads her mom gave her and lay low, it seem Dudley wasn't the worst bully around, she can still pretend she's average building her time like when she was hiding in the public library, she told nobody that she actually read almost every book she could found there when her aunt was pushing her outside when her friends were coming for a daily gossip tea party . she started coming when she was 4 and soon was moving from child's book to magical story and fantasy book, when she started to real Bilbo the hobbit she found in that book like a kinship as her too was living in a hole. 

Harriet was snapped out of her introspective musings by a rather loud cough. She opened her eyes to see Brodkrat standing beside her bed, a smug amusement playing on his face. His eyes twinkled with mischief in the candlelight as he took in her dishevelled appearance. In the dimly lit room, Grimbold's stern figure standing next to Brodkrat.
In the doorway, two figures hovered, their forms cast in the flickering light. The first was a goblin she hadn't seen before, clad in a crimson robe that stood out like a beacon in the otherwise monotone colour palette of the room. He had a sharp look about him, his eyes gleaming with curiosity and something that might have been excitement. Behind him loomed a young wizard who bore an uncanny resemblance to a redheaded Crocodile Dundee, his freckles standing out like a constellation against his pale skin, and his posture exuding an air of rugged competence that belied his youthful appearance. The wizard's attire was simple and functional, a stark contrast to the opulent garb of his goblin counterpart. They both watched her with a mix of concern and fascination, their presence adding an unexpected twist to the unfolding drama.

"Well, Miss," Brodkrat began, his smirk widening slightly, "I see you've found yourself in quite the profound meditative state. I trust it was enlightening?" His tone was teasing, but the glint in his eyes suggested he was genuinely curious about her thoughts. "This is Gornuk," he nodded towards the crimson-robed goblin, "A master of ancient runes and enchantments. And this," he jerked his thumb at the wizard, "Is curse-breaker Weasley, only curse-breaker under oath with Gringotts’s are authorised to wield their wand in the administrative part of Gringotts’s. Grimbold thought it prudent to have a second opinion, especially after the last... incident."

"Grimbold, I thought you just left," Harriet said, her voice still laced with the exhaustion of fever, but the sharpness of her gaze had returned. She glanced from the crimson-robed goblin to the freckled wizard, her curiosity piqued. "What's going on here… again ?"

"Miss, Grimbold came in my office 2 hours ago to talk about your new little stunt," Brodkrat said, his smirk growing into a full-fledged grin, "you truly have a knack for keeping us on our toes. you never cease to amaze me with your... unpredictability. Two days of peace and quiet, and here we are, with you at the center of the storm yet again." He stepped closer to the bed, his eyes sweeping over her, the candlelight dancing off the various instruments and vials scattered around the room. "Your little stunt, as I like to call it, has stirred quite the pot. It seems ever consigned to your bed, trouble follows like a loyal shadow. Gornuk," he gestured to the crimson-robed goblin, "will be assisting in the analysis of the rune on your forehead. He's the best we've got for matters such as these."


"But I've already told you everything I know," Harriet protested, her eyes flickering to the leather-bound diary in Gornuk's hand. "And I've given you the diary to copy..." she said, her voice trailing off as she tried to piece together the last few hours in her mind. Her thoughts were a jumble of fever-induced headache. She took a deep breath. "What more can you possibly need from me ?"

Gornuk stepped closer to the bed, his crimson robes sweeping the floor. He studied Harriet with an intensity that seemed to burn through her. "The rune," he began, his voice a low rumble that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the room, "Is indeed ancient, a relic of a time when the world was a much darker place.” He paused, his gaze lingering on the black goo that had seeped from the rune, his expression a mix of fascination and concern. "The taint within is... disturbing. But do not worry, we shall uncover the truth and find a way to purge it."
His gaze fell upon the diary. "The problem, Miss Potter, is that the text within this book is enchanted, neither me, curse breaker Weasley or Brodkrat are able to read those pages... even Grimbold is just able to read the page you have directly showed him...”
Gornuk's crimson eyes bore into Harriet's, his expression unreadable. "It seems that the author has placed a Fidelius Charm on the pages of this diary. Only the secret keeper can reveal its content." He handed her the diary. "We must proceed with caution. The diary holds secrets that could be vital to understanding the rune's behaviour,"

She flicked through the pages of the diary once more. "But it's more than that, isn't it?" she asked, her gaze meeting Gornuk's. She stopped on the page describing the soul rune and pointed to it. "Look," she said, her voice a mix of challenge and curiosity. She handed the diary back to Gornuk, her eyes never leaving his.
As Gornuk took the diary from her outstretched hand, his eyes widened with understanding. He sat down heavily in the chair beside the bed, his hands trembling slightly as he scanned the pages. The crimson light from the candles reflected off the meticulous handwriting, creating an eerie dance of shadows across his furrowed brow.
Harriet's heart skipped a beat as Curse-breaker Weasley approached, his wand drawn. The shadows in the room grew darker, and she felt the cold steel of fear clamp around her heart. "Please," she managed to croak out, her voice a whisper of its former self. "I've been through enough." She swallowed hard. "What are you planning to do?" Her voice shaky

The room grew tense as Harriet's breathing grew ragged, her chest rising and falling rapidly. The crimson glow of the candles cast a stark contrast to her ashen complexion, highlighting the stark reality of her fear. Her eyes darted to the glowing tip of the wand, and she couldn't help the memories that flooded her mind. The panic grew, a vice around her chest that squeezed tighter with every shallow breath she took. The walls of the chamber closed in on her, the air thick. She felt the weight of her history pressing down on her, a burden she never asked for but now had to bear. The room grew fuzzy around the edges, and she could feel the heat of the fever burning through her body, mixing with the cold sweat that beaded on her brow. Her hand clutched her chest.
Harriet's thoughts were a whirlwind, a cacophony of moments from her past.
Harriet looked at the guys starting to come closer, when he drew his want she could help but start to have a panic attack, he breathing raw as he pointed his wand at her the tip starting to glow , she closed her eyes, she couldn't help the image coming in her mind, another wand at night, the screamed desperate plea of the woman "take me, not her" the raw terror in her voice a knife to Harriet's soul, the sharp pain on her forehead, the scary man told her to move aside. the pain of the past searing through her as if it were happening once more. She felt the warmth of tears trickling down her cheeks, her breathing erratic as she relived that fateful night. 
she wanted to protect the woman so much, she doesn't want to lose her again, she doesn't want to feel it again. She didn't want to be a victim again, didn't want to experience the loss that had defined her life so far., doesn't want to be hurt, She pushed back with all her might, blasting the curse breaker across the room as her magic ran wild her forehead burning more than anything she ever felt. Curse-breaker Weasley's body crashing into the far side of the room, his own wand clattering to the ground.
the room spinning as if caught in a tornado of shadows and candlelight. The pain in her forehead was unbearable, a raging bonfire consuming her very essence. She could feel the rune fighting back against the taint, its power a living, breathing entity pulsing in time with her heartbeat. Her magic surged like a wild beast breaking free of its chains, a maelstrom of energy that sent everything in her vicinity flying.
The crimson-robed Gornuk barely had time to react before he was thrown against the stone wall, his eyes wide with shock as the air around her crackled with an uncontainable force. The diary fell from his grip, its pages fluttering like the wings of a dying bird as it landed on the cold, hard floor. 
her mind reeled, the agony of the rune's battle a cacophony in her thoughts, as she desperately tried to regain control over the chaos she had unleashed.
 she wanted it to stop to never feel that pain again, not just against the fear, but against the very essence of the darkness that sought to consume her ...  she felt like her head was splitting in half as she heard a horrendous scream, A scream that didn't belong to her. it pierced her soul like an icy shard.

Grimbold and Brodkrat had taken cover behind the heavy oak door, their eyes wide with horror as they watched the scene unfold. Harriet, still lying on the bed, felt the cold sweat of fear mingle with the feverish heat that already drenched her, her body trembling uncontrollably.
Grimbold and Brodkrat stared in horror from behind the heavy oak door, their expressions mirroring the very essence of dread. The dark shape that had emerged from Harriet's forehead was a manifestation of pure malevolence, a twisted and sinister spectre that seemed to feed on the very air of the chamber. Its form was indistinct, a writhing mass of shadow and malice that coalesced into the shape of a serpent, its eyes a baleful red that burned like coals in the night.
The creature's screech was a sound that seemed to shatter the very fabric of reality, sending a chill down the spines of all who heard it. The air grew colder, the candles flickering wildly as if in fear of the darkness that had been unleashed. The goblins' eyes were wide with terror, their hands shaking as they held their staffs in a futile attempt to ward off the creature.
The crimson light from the candles cast a macabre dance of shadows on the walls, painting a grim tableau of the battle unfolding before them. The room itself seemed to pulse with a sinister life of its own, the stones groaning in protest at the unnatural power.
the creature recoiled, its form flickering and distorting as if it trying to go back in Harriet. But it wasn't retreating. No, it was regrouping, preparing for another assault.
And in the midst of it all, Harriet. Her fists clenched at her sides.
The atmosphere in the room was thick with tension, the very air charged with the electricity of unbridled emotion and power. The fate of not just Harriet, but of Gringotts itself, seemed to hang in the balance, suspended in the shadowy embrace of the creature that sought to claim her soul.
 The scream had come from her, a primal cry of anguish and rage that resonated through the very foundations of the ancient bank. 
With a final blast of magic, the shape was banished, the room plunging into a sudden and profound silence. The candles, which had been flaring wildly, now burned steadily once more, casting their warm glow on the scene of the battle. Harriet slumped to the floor, her body spent, her breathing shallow and ragged. The crimson light painted her in stark relief against the cold stone, a stark contrast to the lifeblood seeping from her forehead. The creature had been defeated.
Grimbold and Brodkrat rushed into the room, their eyes scanning for any sign of the creature's return. The young wizard, Curse-breaker Weasley, picked himself up from the floor, his wand arm trembling slightly from the effort of containing the explosion of magic. Gornuk remained pinned to the wall, his breaths coming in short, sharp gasps as he stared at the spot where the creature had been.
The room, once filled with the clamour of fear and chaos, now held the quietude of a tomb, the only sound the heavy breaths of those present and the distant echo of the creature's scream fading into oblivion.
The rune on Harriet's forehead had dimmed, her breath heavy and ragged. But the crimson stain remained leaking from her forehead, a stark reminder of the battle that had just taken place. The air was thick with the scent of burnt fabric and the acrid tang of dispelled dark magic, a testament to the power that had been unleashed.
The goblins exchanged a grave look, understanding the gravity of the situation that had just unfolded before their very eyes.
And in that moment, as she lay on the bed, the sheets cold and damp form her fever, Harriet lost the battle to stay conscious.
