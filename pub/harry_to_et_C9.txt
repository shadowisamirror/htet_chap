"Harriet," she said gently with caution. "While I understand your need for family, you must tread carefully. Sirius Black is..." 
Harriet raised a hand to silence Andromeda, her eyes filled with a quiet resolve that seemed to have grown stronger in the face of the revelations. "Please, Andromeda," she said softly, "I know you want to protect me, But right now, It's all just too much." She gave a small, forced smile. "Could we maybe study a bit before Grimbold comes back with the potion?" Her eyes searched Andromeda's. "Just... I need some time to process everything," she admitted, her voice cracking slightly.

Of course, Harriet," she responded with a warm smile, recognizing the need to change the subject.
They spent the rest of the day studying in a quiet, companionable silence and quill scratches. Harriet absorbed knowledge like a sponge, eager to learn everything she could about the world she had been kept from for so long. Andromeda offered insights from her perspective, explaining the nuances and complexities of the wizarding world's history and culture. Her voice was a soothing balm, guiding Harriet through the tumultuous sea of information, offering the comfort of an experienced hand in uncharted waters... They discussed everything from Charms to History of Magic, and even the complexities of inter-species politics.
As the ancient clock on the wall crept closer to 4 PM. The heavy thud of footsteps approached, echoing down the corridor, and the door creaked open. Grimbold entered, his expression solemn, carrying a small crystal vial filled with a shimmering potion. "Flower’s daughter," he began, "It's time we tended to your eyes." The room grew still.
Grimbold spoke with a gentle firmness, his eyes reflecting a blend of professionalism and care. "The potion is ready," he said, holding up the vial, which glinted in the dim light of the chamber. "Three drops in each eye, and you must keep your eyes bandaged for 48 hours." He paused, his gaze flicking to Andromeda before returning to Harriet. "Your sight will be restored, but it's a powerful potion. It may cause some temporary discomfort." He moved closer.
Harriet nodded solemnly, her eyes flicking to Andromeda before returning to meet Grimbold's gaze. She knew the risks and the potential pain, but she was ready. "I understand," she murmured, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. She took a deep breath and leaned back in her bed.
With a gentle touch, Grimbold tipped the crystal vial, allowing three glistening drops to fall into Harriet's left eye. She twitched but kept her eyes open, the potion stinging like a thousand tiny needles, but she was used to pain. The process was repeated in her right eye. The potion shimmered, casting a soft glow that briefly outlined her irises before the pain grew more intense. He then carefully placed a soft, clean bandage around her eyes, tying it securely but not too tightly. The room swam in a symphony of colour and light, and she felt a warmth spread from her eyes to the back of her head. "Lie still," he instructed, his voice a soothing balm in the sea of sensations. "The potion needs to work without interference."

"Thank you, healer Grimbold" Harriet whispered to Grimbold as he left the room, her voice barely a murmur. The pain receded after a few moments, leaving in its wake a numb, itchy sensation.

As the potion's warmth spread through her head, Harriet felt the tension in her body slowly melt away. She lay back, Andromeda's voice, reading from an ancient tome, was a comforting background noise. Harriet's mind drifted, the absence of pain in her forehead a peculiar sensation she never felt before coming in Gringotts’s. It was a peculiar sensation, this newfound sense of awareness without sight. she turned inward, focusing on the subtle shifts and sensations within her body. Her skin seemed to hum with a newfound awareness, a silent symphony of nerve endings coming alive. She could, hear the distant whispers of the bank's activities, and the faint flutter of pages as Andromeda turned them. It was a strange kind of freedom, being denied her most dominant sense yet being allowed to focus on the others.
Harriet could feel a sensation she never been aware before, as her mind reached out tentatively, she felt Andromeda's presence beside her, not just hearing her but her presence, she tried to focus on that sensation. it was a strange sensation, like smelling something wet with her ears, but she could definitely feel it now that she was trying to focus on it.  as she started to focus around she could feel her bed buzzing that was funny.

half listening andromeda story, it was like everything andromeda was helping her to study, something she already knew but forgot, so she focused on the new sensation, poking things around her, the cold solid wall, the flickering torch , and the she started to focus on herself, this newfound sensation helped her to settle the slight morphing of her body, and then she felt the rune on her forehead, it was welcoming, warm, almost burning with love.
she was brought out of her musing bathing in the warm hugs of her rune, by andromeda clapping the book shut.

"It seems the day has drawn to a close," Andromeda said gently, her voice carrying a hint of reluctance. She placed the book on the side table with a soft thud. "I must leave you now, Harriet, but I shall return tomorrow." She reached out to squeeze Harriet's hand reassuringly, her eyes searching the bandaged face for any signs of distress. "You'll be fine here, won't you?" she asked, her voice laced with genuine concern. "I know this is all overwhelming, but you are stronger than you know."
"Thank you, Andromeda," Harriet replied, her voice a soft whisper in the hushed room. "I'll be okay. I have a lot to think about." She took a deep breath, the scent of ancient parchment and the faint metallic tang of the potion lingering in the air. "I'll use the time to rest and... to process everything." She paused, swallowing hard against the sudden lump in her throat. "I know I can't change the past, but I want to understand it."

"Good night, dear," she murmured, her voice a warm embrace in the cool air. With a lingering squeeze of Harriet's hand, she rose from the chair and made her way to the door. As she stepped out into the corridor, the sound of her footsteps faded away, leaving Harriet in the gentle embrace of her thoughts.
The quiet of the room enveloped Harriet like a blanket, her senses heightened by the darkness behind the bandages. She reached out with her mind, feeling the comforting presence of Andromeda retreat, leaving her alone with the whispers of the Gringotts halls. Memories flooded her - the coldness of the Dursleys' home, the bitterness of betrayal of those who should have looked after her, the warmth of her mother's love. Her heart ached for the truth hidden in the shadows of her past. The rune on her forehead pulsed with warmth, a silent reminder of the love she had once, and she clung to that warmth as she drifted into a meditative state.
The door cracked open, interrupting the quiet solitude of the chamber. "Hello, flower's daughter," the goblin's voice reverberated through the small space, a gentle intrusion into Harriet's introspection. It was Gornuk, the scholarly goblin who had previously graced her with the enlightenment of the rune on her forehead.
"Gornuk," she greeted him, her voice a soft melody in the otherwise silent room. "I wasn't expecting you." There was a hint of curiosity in her tone, "What brings you here?"
Gornuk's footsteps grew closer, the clacking of his shoes on the stone floor a rhythmic counterpoint to the silence. "I heard you wish to learn about goblin culture," he began, his voice carrying the warmth of someone eager to share knowledge. "And I, in turn, am intrigued by your unique... circumstances. Perhaps we could help one another?" He paused beside her bed, the torchlight dancing across his sharp features, casting intricate shadows on the wall. "I shall regale you with tales of our people, their triumphs and tragedies, their laws and their legends, while you let me read flower's research diary , I could event explain to you the more complex part of her research" His tone remained measured, but the interest was palpable, a silent question lingering in the air.
"I would truly appreciate that, Gornuk," Harriet replied with a smile she hoped conveyed her enthusiasm despite her inability to see. "But, as you can see," she gestured to the bandages swathing her eyes, "I'm currently unable to read."
"But," she continued, her voice filled with quiet determination, "I can certainly listen." Her mind reached out tentatively, feeling the warm, solid presence of the goblin beside her. "Please, tell me about your people. I want to understand everything." The rune on her forehead pulsed in response to her words, a silent echo of her mother's love and hope, reminding her of the legacy she bore and the truths she sought.
Gornuk nodded, his eyes glinting beneath his heavy brows. "Very well," he said, "But know that the tales of our culture are long and filled with lessons that may not always be pleasant." He took a seat beside her bed, his posture formal yet relaxed. "We goblins value honour and trust above all else. It is the currency of our existence, the foundation of our society. it is not a mere cultural difference between wizard and goblin. goblin like most of magical being is deeply rooted in the magic around us. Magic is a natural force like an ocean, sometimes the water can be as smooth as glass, or it can be a raging sea..." 
Harriet was listening to Gornuk, while poking him with her newfound sensitivity, he was like smelling metal. But it was different than andromeda, andromeda leaked her aura, for lack of better word, bot Gornuk it was much more subdued. Harriet was poking and probing with curiosity.
Gornuk shredder under her unseen probing. "Could you... refrain from that, please?" he requested, his voice maintaining its scholarly tone. "It's quite disconcerting, and not exactly appropriate." He cleared his throat, his eyes narrowing slightly as he felt the intrusion of her senses into his personal space. 
"Oh, I'm sorry," she said with a touch of embarrassment, retracting her sensory exploration. "I didn't know it would bother you." She paused, her heart racing with the sudden realization of her faux pas. "I'm still getting used to this... new way of feeling things." Her voice held a note of apology, but there was also a hint of excitement, as if she had stumbled upon a new facet of her world.
Gornuk nodded in understanding, his features softening slightly. "It's not feelings things, it's feeling magic," he explained, his voice taking on a teacher's cadence. "Every magical being has its own sensitivity, but it seems your... unique situation has heightened yours. For us goblins, we can feel magic around us on our skin, like the whisper of a cool breeze or the gentle hum of a distant waterfall. We teach our young ones to control this sensitivity from a very young age, to refrain from spreading their magic like you just did. It has considered as inappropriate as running around naked and touching everyone's skin without their consent," he added, "But, as your eyes heal, I suspect you'll find a balance, a way to harness this gift without invading the privacy of others." He leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking slightly. 
The air grew thick with anticipation as the goblin's voice painted a vivid picture of his people's struggles. "Most wizards," he began, his words measured and precise, "don't even take care to understand our ways. They live in ignorance of the magic that surrounds and suffuses us all, leaking their own nature and feelings into the very fabric of the world, they leak their nature, and feeling. And yet, they claim superiority." His voice grew stronger, the room seeming to shrink around them as his words carried the weight of his people's anger and resilience. "This blatant disregard is why our kind often view wizards as a threat when they come at us with nefarious intent, and why our interactions have been... complicated." He paused, his gaze drilling into the darkness where he knew Harriet's eyes were hidden beneath the bandages. "But when they come to us with greed and deceit, we strike pre-emptively to act in our own defence. To them, it seems like we are the aggressors, but to us, it is survival. These are the moments started what that history often calls 'goblin's revolts'." His eyes glinted in the torchlight, a silent testament to the fierce spirit of his kind.
Gornuk paused for a moment, allowing the gravity of his words to settle over the chamber. The torch flickered, casting eerie shadows across the walls, as if the very stones were listening in. "Now that you're aware of your own magic, it's crucial to practice control. Probing goblins unbidden is a breach of our sacred personal space, much like a wizard reading another's mind without permission." He took a deep, steadying breath.
"I see," Harriet said, her voice a solemn echo in the small space. "What you're saying, it's... it's eye-opening." She took a moment, her mind racing with the implications of her newfound sensitivity. "I had no idea my magic could be so... invasive." Her tone was earnest, filled with the gravity of her realization. "I'll work on it. I don't want to cause any trouble, especially not with peoples who’ve been so kind to me." She leaned back into the pillows, her eyes hidden beneath the bandages.

"What do you mean, Gornuk?" she asked, her voice a blend of innocence and concern. "Wizards can read minds without permission?" The very thought of someone invading her thoughts was repugnant, sending a shiver down her spine. "How is that even possible?"
Gornuk's expression grew solemn. "Indeed, young one," he said, his voice carrying the weight of ancient knowledge. "There is an art known as Legilimency that allows a skilled wizard to delve into the thoughts of another, by looking directly in the eyes. much like you unknowingly did with your magic." he added quickly, noticing her distress. "This is a rare and often dark practice, not widely taught or used." He paused, his gaze drifting to the flickering flame of the torch before returning to her. "There is also Occlumency, the art of closing one's mind, a counterbalance to Legilimency. It is a shield, a fortress to protect one's thoughts. Every goblin at Gringotts learns these arts before stepping into the public halls. It is essential for our work, and our survival." His words were measured, each one carrying the gravity of a sacred truth.
"But" he continued, his voice softer, "while the probing of another's mind without consent is a grave violation, the unintentional leakage of one's magic into the world is a different matter. When a wizard's emotions run high, their magic can become as palpable as the air we breathe. It's like the scent of fear or the warmth of anger, seeping into the very fabric of the room. Goblins are particularly attuned to this, as we live so intimately with the magical essence of the earth." He leaned closer, his eyes gleaming in the torchlight. "But let's not dwell on that. Instead, let me regale you with a tale of goblin heroism, one that has been buried by the biased quills of wizarding historians. As for the tales, I shall begin with the legend of the Goblin King's Sword. It is said to be forged from a meteor that fell from the heavens, granting its wielder the power to command the goblin nation." The goblin's words painted a vivid picture in the air, his hands moving with the grace of an artist illustrating a story. The room's atmosphere grew dense with anticipation as the echoes of ancient battles whispered through the stones of the chamber.
The chamber grew quiet as the whispers of the Gringotts halls seemed to hush in Gornuk's narrative. The flickering torch cast a warm glow on the goblin's sharp features, illuminating the depths of his eyes, filled with the fire of his ancestors' spirit. The air grew thick with the story that transport them both to a time of fierce battles and unyielding resolve, a tale that resonate within the very core of their shared experiences.
