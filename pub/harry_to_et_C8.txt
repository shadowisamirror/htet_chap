"Harriet, darling," Andromeda whispered, her voice a soft caress in the dimly lit room, "it's time to wake up." She gently shook the sleep-entangled form of Harriet. She smoothed the hair from Harriet's forehead, her gaze lingering for a moment on the lightning scar that stood out against his pale skin. "Grimbold and Brodkrat will come to see you. They said they'll be here in an hour,"

"Mmph... 'Dromeda," Harriet groaned pulling the cover over her head, curling more hold the box and the diary against her.
"Now, now, Harriet, you’ve got to get up." Andromeda said, her tone firm yet filled with affection as she pulled back the covers, her eyes dancing with a glimpse of playfulness, " Remember, I've had a teenage daughter. I know all the tricks to get you ready for an appointment." 

"Very well, Miss Potter." Andromeda said, her voice calm as Harriet doesn't want to move, she started. "The onset of labor is marked by the beginning of cervical dilation as the new-born prepares for delivery..." she began to explain the medical process of labor.

"I’m up. I’m up." Harriet interrupted, the words rushing out as she sat up in bed, her cheeks flushing with a mix of annoyance and embarrassment. She looked over to Andromeda, her voice rising in panic. her cheeks burning.

Andromeda gave Harriet an amused smile. "I'm glad you've finally decided to stand," she said, pulling a small package out of her bag. "Breakfast is ready, and I've brought you something special to help you feel more at ease today." She handed the package to Harriet, her eyes twinkling with a gentle mischief that suggested she had something comforting in store.
"Thanks, Andromeda," Harriet said, her voice still groggy with sleep but tinged with a hint of excitement. She took the package with trembling hands, her curiosity piqued. "What's this?" she asked, peering at the wrapped object with a furrowed brow.

Andromeda said with a knowing smile. "Underwear, my dear. Enchanted for comfort." She watched as Harriet's eyes widened “It's essential that you take care of yourself, especially now. And as for the shower," she paused, her tone growing more serious, "you've been avoiding it for too long.” She watched Harriet with a gentle gaze, her concern for the girl's well-being evident. "Remember, understanding your body is part of growing up, and I'm here to guide you through it."
Harriet looked down at the package in her lap, her cheeks burning brighter than a dragon's breath. "Thank you," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. The gesture, though simple, resonated deeply within her. It was moments like these that made her realize the stark contrast between the cold, confined life she had led as Harry and the warm, nurturing environment she had found as Harriet. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the new name and identity, she tries to embrace. "I'll... I'll get ready," she managed, her voice stronger now. She knew she couldn't hide under the covers forever. She had to embrace this new chapter of her life, no matter how unfamiliar and terrifying it seemed.
Harriet took a deep breath, her legs still trembling slightly, and she stood up from the bed. She clutched the enchanted underwear to her chest, and the clothes andromeda gave her yesterday. The situation weighed heavily upon her, but she knew that she had to face it head-on. With a newfound resolve, she made her way to the bathroom, the cold tiles a under her bare feet contrast to the warmth of the bed she'd just left. She stepped into the shower, allowing the water to wash away the last traces of sleep, focusing on the sound of the droplets echoing in the tiled bathroom. 
As the warm water cascaded over her body, Harriet felt the truth of her new identity wash over her. she soaped her body, Bit by bit, the truth settles in, and with it, her shock growing swift and merciless, leaving only shock in its wake. she whipped slightly grieving for her lost identity, she had to accept this, she wasn't harry potter anymore, even she didn't feel like Harriet... She felt the grief swell within her, a mourning for the life she had known.
Yet amidst the turmoil, she found a seedling of strength. She'd always been a survivor, and she knew she had to be now more than ever. She stepped out of the shower, feeling both lost and found all at once. She would face Grimbold and Brodkrat, and she'd do it as Harriet.
She emerged from the bathroom, her damp hair clinging to her neck. She sat down at the small table and began to quietly pick at the breakfast. She took a deep breath, focusing on the comforting scent of the food. Andromeda watched her, her eyes filled with a gentle understanding. Harriet knew she couldn't hide, she had to face this new chapter of her life, even if it meant confronting her fears and the unknown. With each bite, she felt a little more grounded, a little more ready for whatever the day would bring. whoever did that to her, they would pay.
As Harriet sat lost in her thoughts, the door to the room creaked open, and in stepped Grimbold and Brodkrat. The room grew tense as their footsteps echoed against the cold stone floor. Grimbold, spoke first. "Flower's daughter, I'm glad to see you out of bed." His expression was a curious blend of relief and sternness, his eyes scanning over her as if assessing her health and strength. The atmosphere grew heavy with the weight of their unspoken concerns and the gravity of the situation, the torch flickering as if in response to the tension.
"Thank you, Grimbold," she said, her voice steady despite her racing heart. She took a deep breath, focusing on the warmth of the toast in her hand. She had to stay calm, had to keep her cool. This was her life now, and she had to face it head-on. She looked up, her eyes meeting Grimbold's with a fierce determination. her newfound resolve to conquer her fears and embrace the path laid before her.
Grimbold's eyes softened slightly as he continued, his voice measured and professional. "Your recovery is progressing more swiftly than anticipated. We are quite impressed with your resilience. If this rate continues, I suspect you may be released from our care by next Monday. I will return this afternoon with a potion for your eyes, and in two days' time, we shall remove the bandages. Until then, continue to eat well and rest. Your well-being is of the utmost importance to us." The goblin doctor spoke with the confidence of one who had seen much in his long years of practice, yet there was a hint of uncertainty in his tone that made the air thick with anticipation.
"Understood," Harriet said. "I was expecting people to come and see me tomorrow." She took a sip of her tea, the warmth spreading through her as she swallowed her fear. "Would it be troublesome?"
"Not at all," Grimbold replied, raising an eyebrow at her assumption. "Your anticipation is quite astute. Indeed, we had a discussion with Mrs. Tonks this very morning regarding the possibility of arranging a visit for you." He leaned slightly forward, his gaze intense. "However, we must ensure your safety and well-being before any decisions are made. Could you, perhaps, enlighten us as to whom you are expecting, Miss Potter?" The torchlight danced across his metallic spectacles, casting intricate shadows on the furrowed lines of his face. The room held its breath, waiting for her response.
Harriet swallowed hard, the bread she had been chewing suddenly dry in her mouth. She took a deep breath, pushing aside her nerves. "They're kids of my mother's friends," she began, her voice steady despite the racing of her heart. "I sent them a message through the box, asking if they'd like to meet." She paused, looking down at her plate. "They agreed to come to Gringotts. I thought we could use one of the meeting rooms. It's safer for everyone that way." She looked up at Grimbold and Brodkrat, her eyes shining with a mix of hope and trepidation. "They're bringing their parents, too. They're worried, but I assured them we'd be safe here."
	

"Ah, I see," Grimbold mused thoughtfully. "The scheduling for your eye treatment remains unchanged. I shall return this afternoon with the potion. regarding your visitors, as long it is not detrimental to your health, it is possible. First, we must attend to the healing of your eyesight. provided that the necessary security measures are in place, your guests may be granted an audience. I will leave you with Brodkrat." he gave a curt nod and leave the room.
Brodkrat let out a gruff sigh. "Flower's daughter," he grumbled, "you do know how to stir the cauldron, don't you?" His gruff tone didn't quite hide the hint of affection. "Ever since you arrived, it's been one thing after another. Very well, I shall speak with the head of security. We shall make the necessary arrangements for your little reunion." His voice was filled with the weight of his words, a blend of exasperation and admiration for the resilience of the young witch.
"Sorry," Harriet said sheepishly, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I told them to ask for Flower's daughter." 
"flower's daughter," Brodkrat began, his voice a low rumble as he shuffled through a stack of parchments, "I've reviewed the ledger you entrusted me with yesterday." The goblin's eyes narrowed, his clawed fingers tapping against the ancient paper. "It seems your late account manager had quite the... ambitious spirit. He has been levying fees beyond the ordinary. Unauthorized, of course. It's as if he thought your vault would never be checked." The goblin's eyes glinted in the torchlight as he spoke, revealing a hint of his own cunning. "These fees were for facilitating weekly withdrawals from your trust vault, without the proper approvals, from you or your current magical guardian." He paused, watching her reaction, his expression a mask of professional neutrality.


She took a deep breath, feeling a mix of anger and betrayal. her gaze unwavering as she studied Brodkrat's face. The goblin's demeanour didn't just suggest that he was stating a fact; it was a subtle test, a lesson in reading between the lines. It dawned on her that he was expecting her to understand the implications of his words, to grasp the gravity of the situation on her own. He wasn't just recounting events; he was challenging her to form her own conclusions, to demonstrate her readiness to navigate the treacherous waters of her new life. 
"I see," she said, her voice calm despite the tempest of emotions swirling within her. "Can I start by appointing you as my new manager?" It wasn't just a question; it was a declaration, a statement of trust. Harriet knew that she needed someone she could rely on in this world, someone who knew the truth about her, someone who could help her navigate the complexities of her inheritance and the shadow of her past. She met Brodkrat's gaze, her eyes filled with determination. "I want to make sure my vault is handled with the respect and honesty it deserves," she added, her voice firm and resolute.
As Brodkrat nodded solemnly, Harriet felt a flicker of hope. She knew that she had made the right choice in confiding in him. "What can you tell me about those withdrawals?" she asked, her voice steady and inquisitive. She leaned slightly forward, her eyes narrowed with a hint of curiosity. "I want to understand what's been happening with my vault and ensure its managed correctly from now on." The weight of her words hung in the air, a promise to stand firm against any future deceptions. She was no longer the lost boy Harry; she was Harriet Potter, ready to face the challenges of her legacy.
"Indeed," Brodkrat began, his voice a low rumble that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the chamber. "Every Saturday, without fail, a withdrawal of 499 galleons was made from your account." His sharp eyes gleamed with the unspoken understanding that he knew full well the implications of such a deliberate number. "Just shy of the threshold requiring direct verification from yourself or your legal guardian." He paused, allowing the significance of his words to sink in. "If you wish, Miss Potter, we can revoke the existing key's access and issue a new one under tighter security measures. It would require a visit to the vault in person, of course, but it would ensure that no further unauthorized transactions occur." His tone was measured, his words a delicate dance of fact and implication, painting a vivid picture of the clandestine operations that had been taking place under her very nose.
She looked sharply at Brodkrat, her heart racing as she considered his words. "No," she said firmly, her voice echoing the steel within her soul. "Don't revoke it yet." She paused, her eyes darting around the room as she formulated a plan. "Can you put a tracker on the galleon to see where it goes?" It was a risky move, but one she felt compelled to take. "We need to find out who's behind this, and why they're doing it."  Harriet was not one to shy away from a challenge, not anymore. She would face whatever came her way.

Andromeda watched the exchange with a growing sense of unease, her gaze shifting from Brodkrat's crafty smile to Harriet's determined countenance. She knew all too well the dangers that lurked within the shadows of the wizarding world. She had seen it firsthand with her own sisters. The vicious smile that had briefly graced Brodkrat's lips had not gone unnoticed; she knew that look all too well.

Brodkrat's grin grew wider, his sharp teeth glinting in the torchlight. his eyes gleaming with something akin to respect. "We can indeed track the galleon, Miss Potter. For a small fee, of course." The goblin's words hung in the air, a silent acknowledgment of the cunning she had just displayed.
Harriet nodded, her gaze unwavering as she processed the information. "Good," she said, she knew the price of information in this world was rarely free, her voice steady despite the turmoil of emotions within her. Turning to Andromeda, turning to face her with a furrowed brow, "What's a magical guardian?"
Andromeda's gaze softened as she took a step closer to Harriet, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "A magical guardian, dear, is the person the wizarding world recognizes as responsible for you, especially when your own parents aren't around." She paused; her eyes filled with understanding. "In most cases, it's a parent or a tutor, but for someone like you, a muggleborn with no living relatives in the wizarding world, it's someone else the Ministry of Magic appoints. It's usually a trusted magical individual who ensures your safety and well-being." Her voice was firm but gentle, offering support while explaining the complexities of her new reality.
Harriet caught the smug look on Brodkrat's face, knowing she had caught the inconsistency in Andromeda's story. She took a deep breath, her eyes flashing with a hint of the fire. "Andromeda, I think there's something you've left out," she said, her voice measured and firm. "You said like muggleborn, like me, but that's not true. Both of my parents are magical." She turned to Brodkrat, her temper simmering just below the surface. "Tell me, Brodkrat, who is my magical guardian?" The air grew tense, the silence a testament to the gravity of her question. The flickering torchlight cast shadows that danced across the walls, mirroring the tumult of thoughts and feelings within her. She knew the answer could change a lot of things.
Brodkrat's smile grew into a proud smirk as he nodded in approval. " Sharp as ever, flower's daughter.," he said, his eyes gleaming with a hint of mischief. " You see as Gringotts inquisitor I had to look for your guardian to notice him about the situation of is charge... but as your new steward, itis within my purview to inform you about ... oversight of my predecessor... A magical guardian is indeed a figure of authority in young magical life. it is someone who his granted legal responsibility for your well-being. Given your unique circumstances, with your true lineage concealed, the guardianship of harry James potter, by ministerial decision, was assumed by albus Dumbledore." his gaze shrewd as he studied her reaction.
Andromeda felt a surge of tension in the room, the very air thick with the unspoken truths and the magic that seemed to crackle around Harriet. Her eyes narrowed as she noticed the girl's temper flaring up, the magic in the air becoming palpable. Concern etched on her face, she spoke with urgency, "I need to fetch something," she announced, her voice calm but firm. She swiftly made her way out of the chamber, before hurrying to the infirmary to grab the potion, her mind racing with the implications of what she had just heard.

Brodkrat's smile faded, replaced by a stern expression that spoke of a deep commitment to his kind's ancient traditions. "Goblins, Miss Potter," he began, his voice a low rumble that seemed to resonate with the very core of the ancient bank, "we are not bound by human politics and legalities. We follow the unyielding laws of magic and blood. Our traditions are ancient and unbending. the oversight of your previous guardianship claim is something we cannot ignore. It was a grave mistake, one that has left a stain upon our record.

"But" he continued, his eyes gleaming with a sly intelligence, "my predecessor was bribed, and he let this... claim slip through the cracks, allowing it to affect your trust vault. We will not be party to such deceit. If you want, you may remain under our protection until your rightful guardianship is restored." The air grew thick with tension as the weight of his words sank in, the shadows cast by the torches dancing on their faces as if to emphasize the gravity of the situation.

Andromeda strode back into the chamber, her arms laden with bottles of Calming Draught. She could feel the storm of emotions brewing within Harriet, a tempest that could not be ignored. her eyes scanning the girl's tightly controlled expression. She knew that look all too well; it was the mask one wore when the world felt like it was crumbling around them. With careful precision, she placed the bottles on the nearest table.

"Thank you" she replied, her voice calm despite the tumult of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. "I appreciate your honesty, and I understand your position." She took a deep breath, her eyes never leaving the goblin's, a silent acknowledgment of the gravity of the situation. "What happened to my previous account manager?" She asked, her curiosity piqued by the implication of bribery. The room remained still, the only sound the crackling of the torches, the air charged with the promise of revelation.

Brodkrat's smile grew predatory, his teeth sharpening as he spoke. "Your previous account manager has been..."  his voice a low purr that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the chamber. «...shortened" The goblin's eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement, the corners of his mouth twitching upwards as he enjoyed her shock.
Andromeda's gasp echoed through the chamber, a stark reminder of the tension that had built up between the three of them. Harriet turned to her, her eyes filled with a determination that had not been there before.
Harriet looked seriously at Brodkrat "good.”
Andromeda's eyes widened in horror at the goblin's words, but she quickly composed herself. She knew that the world of magic was not always kind, she turned to Harriet, her gaze filled with a gentle concern. "Dear," she said, her voice softer now, "try not to let anger guide your words. You've come so far, and you mustn't let the shadows of the past define your future." Her hand squeezed Harriet's shoulder briefly, offering silent comfort.
Her eyes never leaving andromeda, her voice tightly controlled, Harriet said, "Graglast broke goblin law, and he paid the price for it. I didn't wish for his punishment, but he made his choices. He was an instrument in keeping me in the dark, leaving me to rot with my relatives." Her jaw clenched at the mention of the Dursleys. " I do understand the gravity of this situation, But I won't mourn him.”








The chamber grew quiet again, the crackling of the torches the only sound that pierced the silence. The shadows on the walls stretched and danced, seeming to echo the tumult of emotions within. Brodkrat's expression remained stoic as he spoke, his eyes flicking between the two witches. "We must focus on the matter at hand. His gaze turned to Harriet, his voice taking on a more serious tone. " "The matter of your guardianship. The lack of proper documentation suggests a deliberate attempt to obscure your true identity. The Ministry's records are not infallible, and it is not unheard of for someone to manipulate them. But it is curious that only a receipt." He tapped the paper with a clawed finger, the sound echoing through the chamber like a drumbeat of impending trouble. “It seems that a receipt of testimony of godparenthood was all that was found. But it is troubling, very troubling... This could have dire consequences for not just you, but for all those connected to you." He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. “It appears that your parents had the foresight to appoint guardians for you, but it is most disturbing that both have not step forward to take custody, soon after your parents' departure from this world."
"Does Gringotts have its own records?" Harriet's voice was soft, almost a whisper, but the question hung in the air like a challenge. The torches in the chamber flickered, casting eerie shadows on her face, which remained impassive, a stark contrast to the turmoil of thoughts within her.
Brodkrat's gaze sharpened, his eyes gleaming with a newfound interest. "Indeed, we do, Miss Potter. But" his tone grew cautious, "by treaty, Gringotts is forbidden to register guardianship or meddle in wizard politics. Our role is to secure and protect your assets, not to dictate the fate of your lineage." His clawed hands steepled together, the gold band on his finger glinting in the firelight. "Our records are bound by ancient laws, true, but they are also shackled by the same treaties that govern our interactions with the wizarding world. We can only act upon the information the Ministry provides us, and it is clear that someone has sought to keep your true heritage hidden." The goblin leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "But fear not, for we are bound by more than laws. We are also bound by honour and a respect for the truth." He paused, his eyes boring into hers, searching for a hint of understanding. "The bank is willing to offer is assistance in uncovering the truth of your guardianship. But beware," he added, his expression darkening, "the path you walk is fraught with danger. The shadows you wish to shed light upon may harbour those who do not wish to see you claim your rightful place."
Brodkrat's expression grew solemn as he spoke with a sense of urgency. "Our records indicate that your grandparent passed away in February 1980, leaving your father as the last known Potter heir. as the ministry doesn't have record of muggle family, we don't have information regarding your mother's lineage." The goblin paused, the air thick with anticipation. "We are currently scouring the archives of the Potter vault for any clue that may reveal your true guardian." he leaned in closer, his voice a mix of caution and resolve."

Her temper, having been simmering beneath the surface, began to rise again. "How convenient," she murmured, her voice laced with sarcasm. The flicker of anger in her eyes grew stronger, a silent challenge to the goblin and his cryptic words. ."Tomorrow, I'll see Moon and Bear, they are Cassandra and Caroll kid... they were my mom best friends. Perhaps they'll have information about Moony and Padfoot too, and what happened to them all."
Andromeda's eyes widened as the name "Padfoot" was spoken, her hand flying to her mouth in a silent gasp. She took a moment to compose herself before speaking, her voice filled with a mix of sadness and concern. "Harriet," she began her voice cracking, "you shouldn't search padfoot... his real name is Sirius black... he is in jail because he betrayed you and your parent to you-know-who..."
"No," Harriet corrected her, looking at Andromeda with a firmness that seemed to surprise even herself. "My mom's letter said he take a woe he can't go against me... he can’t have betray them." She turned to Brodkrat, her eyes a storm of determination. "Now we have a lead."

Brodkrat nodded gravely, his expression a blend of understanding and respect for the fierce determination in Harriet's eyes. "I shall leave you, I shall begin my research into this matter immediately." He stood up from his chair. The goblin's eyes glinted in the flickering light as he met their gazes, one final time, before exiting the chamber, the heavy oak door closing behind him with a thud that seemed to resonate through the very core of the bank.
