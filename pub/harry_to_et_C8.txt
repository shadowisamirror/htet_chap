-"Harriet, dear," Andromeda whispered, her voice a soft caress in the dimly lit room, "it's time to wake up." She gently shook the sleep-entangled form of Harriet. "Grimbold and Brodkrat will come to see you. They said they'll be here in an hour,"
-"Mmph... 'Dromeda," Harriet groaned pulling the cover over her head, curling more hold the box and the diary against her.
-"Now, now, Harriet, you've got to get up." Andromeda said, her tone firm yet filled with affection as she pulled back the covers, her eyes dancing with a glimpse of playfulness, "Remember, I've had a teenage daughter. I know all the tricks to get you ready for an appointment."
As Harriet doesn't want to move, she started "Very well, Miss Potter." Andromeda said, her voice calm. "The onset of labour is marked by the beginning of cervical dilation as the new-born prepares for delivery..." she began to explain the medical process of childbirth.
-"I'm up. I'm up." Harriet interrupted, the words rushing out as she sat up in bed, her cheeks flushing with a mix of annoyance and embarrassment. She looked over to Andromeda, her voice rising in panic. her cheeks burning.
Andromeda gave Harriet an amused smile. "I'm glad you've finally decided to stand," she said, pulling a small package out of her bag. "Breakfast is ready, and I've brought you something special to help you feel more at ease today." She handed the package to Harriet, her eyes twinkling with a gentle mischief that suggested she had something comforting in store.
-"Thanks, Andromeda," Harriet said, her voice still groggy with sleep. She took the package, her curiosity piqued. "What's this?" she asked, peering at the wrapped object with a furrowed brow.
-"Underwear, dear. Enchanted for comfort." Andromeda said with a knowing smile. She watched as Harriet's eyes widened "It's essential that you take care of yourself, especially now. And as for the shower," she paused, her tone growing more serious, "you've been avoiding it for too long. She watched Harriet with a gentle gaze, her concern for the girl's well-being evident. "Remember, understanding your body is part of growing up, and I'm here to guide you through it." Harriet looked down at the package in her lap, her cheeks burning brighter than a dragon's breath.
-"Thank you," she mumbled, her voice barely above a whisper. She wasn't sure how to react but the gesture, though simple, resonated deeply within her. It was moments like these that made her realize the stark contrast between the cold, confined life she had led as Harry and the warm, nurturing environment she had found as Harriet. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the new name and identity, she tries to embrace. "I'll... I'll get ready," she managed, her voice stronger now. She knew she couldn't hide under the covers forever. She had to embrace this new chapter of her life, no matter how unfamiliar and terrifying it seemed.
Harriet took a deep breath, her legs still trembling slightly, and she stood up from the bed. She clutched the enchanted underwear to her chest, and the clothes andromeda gave her yesterday. The situation weighed heavily upon her, but she knew that she had to face it head-on. With a newfound resolve, she made her way to the bathroom, the cold tiles a under her bare feet contrast to the warmth of the bed she'd just left.
She stepped into the shower, allowing the water to wash away the last traces of sleep, focusing on the sound of the droplets echoing in the tiled bathroom. As the warm water cascaded over her body, Harriet felt the truth of her new identity wash over her. she soaped her body, Bit by bit, the truth settles in, and with it, her shock growing swift and merciless, leaving only shock in its wake.
She whipped slightly grieving for her lost identity, she had to accept this, she wasn't Harry Potter anymore, even she didn't feel like Harriet... She felt the grief swell within her, a mourning for the life she had known. Yet amidst the turmoil, she found a seedling of strength. She'd always been a survivor, and she knew she had to be now more than ever.
She stepped out of the shower, feeling both lost and found all at once. She would face Grimbold and Brodkrat, and she'd do it as Harriet.
She emerged from the bathroom, her damp hair clinging to her neck. She sat down at the small table and began to quietly pick at the breakfast. She took a deep breath, focusing on the comforting scent of the food. Andromeda watched her, her eyes filled with a gentle understanding. Harriet knew she couldn't hide, she had to face this new chapter of her life, even if it meant confronting her fears and the unknown.
With each bite, she felt a little more grounded, a little more ready for whatever the day would bring. whoever did that to her, they would pay. As Harriet sat lost in her thoughts, the door to the room creaked open, and in stepped Grimbold and Brodkrat. The room grew tense as their footsteps echoed against the cold stone floor.
Grimbold, spoke first. "Flower's daughter, I'm glad to see you out of bed." His expression was a curious blend of relief and sternness, his eyes scanning over her as if assessing her health and strength. The atmosphere grew heavy with the weight of unspoken concerns, the torch flickering as if in response to the tension.
-"Thank you, Grimbold," she said, her voice steady despite her racing heart. She took a deep breath, focusing on the warmth of the toast in her hand. She had to stay calm, had to keep her cool. This was her life now, and she had to face it head-on. She looked up, her eyes meeting Grimbold's with a fierce determination. her newfound resolve to conquer her fears and embrace the path laid before her.
Grimbold's eyes softened slightly as he continued, his voice measured and professional. "Your recovery is progressing more swiftly than anticipated. We are quite impressed with your resilience. If this rate continues, I suspect you may be released from our care by next Monday. I will return this afternoon with a potion for your eyes, and in two days' time, we shall remove the bandages. Until then, continue to eat well and rest. Your well-being is of the utmost importance to us." The goblin doctor spoke with the confidence of one who had seen much in his long years of practice, yet there was a hint of uncertainty in his tone that made the air thick with anticipation.
-"Understood," Harriet said. "I was expecting people to come and see me tomorrow." She took a sip of her tea, the warmth spreading through her as she swallowed her fear. "Would it be troublesome?"
-"Not at all," Grimbold replied, raising an eyebrow at her assumption. "Your anticipation is quite astute. Indeed, we had a discussion with healer Tonks, this very morning regarding the possibility of arranging a visit for you." He leaned slightly forward, his gaze intense. "However, we must ensure your safety and well-being before any decisions are made. Could you, perhaps, enlighten us as to whom you are expecting?" The torchlight danced casting intricate shadows on the furrowed lines of his face. The room held its breath, waiting for her response.
Harriet swallowed hard, the bread she had been chewing suddenly dry in her mouth. She took a deep breath, pushing aside her nerves. "They're kids of my mother's friends," she began, her voice steady despite the racing of her heart. "I sent them a message through the box, asking if they'd like to meet." She paused, looking down at her plate. "They agreed to come to Gringotts. I thought we could use one of the meeting rooms. It's safer for everyone that way." She looked up at Grimbold and Brodkrat, her eyes shining with a mix of hope and trepidation. "They're bringing their parents, too. They're worried, but I assured them we'd be safe here."
-"Ah, I see," Grimbold mused thoughtfully. "The scheduling for your eye treatment remains unchanged. I shall return this afternoon with the potion. regarding your visitors, as long it is not detrimental to your health, it is possible. Provided that the necessary security measures are in place, your guests may be granted an audience. I will leave you with Brodkrat." he gave a curt nod and leave the room.
Brodkrat let out a gruff sigh. "Flower's daughter," he grumbled, "you do know how to stir the cauldron, don't you?" His gruff tone didn't quite hide the hint of affection. "Ever since you arrived, it's been one thing after another. Very well, I shall speak with the head of security. We shall make the necessary arrangements for your little reunion." His voice was filled with a blend of exasperation and admiration for the resilience of the young witch.
-"Sorry," Harriet said sheepishly, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I told them to ask for Flower's daughter."
Brodkrat nodded "flower's daughter," his voice a low rumble as he shuffled through a stack of parchments, "I've reviewed the ledger you entrusted me with yesterday." The goblin's eyes narrowed, his clawed fingers tapping against the ancient paper. "It seems your late account manager had quite the... ambitious spirit. He has been levying fees beyond the ordinary. Unauthorized, of course. It's as if he thought your vault would never be checked." The goblin's eyes glinted in the torchlight as he spoke, revealing a hint of his own cunning. "These fees were for facilitating weekly withdrawals from your trust vault, without the proper approvals, from you or your rightful magical guardian." He paused, watching her reaction, his expression a mask of professional neutrality.
She took a deep breath, feeling a mix of anger and betrayal. her gaze unwavering as she studied Brodkrat's face. The goblin's demeanour didn't just suggest that he was stating a fact; it was a subtle test, a lesson in reading between the lines. It dawned on her that he was expecting her to understand the implications of his words, to grasp the gravity of the situation on her own. He wasn't just recounting events; he was challenging her to form her own conclusions, to demonstrate her readiness to navigate the treacherous waters of her new life.
-"I see," she said, her voice calm despite the tempest of emotions swirling within her. "Can I start by appointing you as my new manager?" It wasn't just a question; it was a declaration, a statement of trust. Harriet knew that she needed someone she could rely on in this world, someone who knew the truth about her, someone who could help her navigate the complexities of her inheritance and the shadow of her past. She met Brodkrat's gaze, her eyes filled with determination. "I want to make sure my vault is handled with the respect and honesty it deserves," she added, her voice firm and resolute.
As Brodkrat nodded solemnly, Harriet felt a flicker of hope. She knew that she had made the right choice in confiding in him. "What can you tell me about those withdrawals?" she asked, her voice steady and inquisitive. She leaned slightly forward, her eyes narrowed with a hint of curiosity. "I want to understand what's been happening with my vault."
The weight of her words hung in the air, a promise to stand firm against any future deceptions. She was no longer the lost boy Harry; she was Harriet Potter, ready to face the challenges of her legacy.
Brodkrat began, his voice a low rumble that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the chamber. "Every Saturday, without fail, a withdrawal of 499 galleons was made from your account." His sharp eyes gleamed. "Just shy of the threshold requiring direct verification from yourself or your rightful guardian." He paused, allowing the significance of his words to sink in. "If you wish, Miss Potter, we can revoke the existing key's access and issue a new one under tighter security measures. It would require a visit to the vault in person, of course, but it would ensure that no further unauthorized transactions occur." His tone was measured, his words a delicate dance of fact and implication, painting a picture of the clandestine operations that had been taking place under her very nose.
She looked sharply at Brodkrat, her heart racing as she considered his words. "No," she said firmly, her voice echoing the steel within her soul. "Don't revoke it yet." She paused, her eyes darting around the room as she formulated a plan. "Can you put a tracker on the galleon to see where it goes? We need to find out who's behind this, and why they're doing it." Harriet was not one to shy away from a challenge, not anymore. She would face whatever came her way.
Andromeda watched the exchange with a growing sense of unease, her gaze shifting from Brodkrat's crafty smile to Harriet's determined countenance. She knew all too well the dangers that lurked within the shadows of the wizarding world. She had seen it firsthand with her own sisters. The vicious smile that had briefly graced Brodkrat's lips had not gone unnoticed; she knew that look all too well.
Brodkrat's grin grew wider, his sharp teeth glinting in the torchlight, he liked her, she was a warrior, ready to take a hit to be sure to land the final blow to her foe. his eyes gleaming with something akin to respect. "We can indeed track the galleon, flower's daughter. For a small fee, of course." The goblin's words hung in the air, a silent acknowledgment of the cunning she had just displayed.
Harriet nodded, her gaze unwavering as she processed the information. "Good," she said, she knew the price of information in this world was rarely free, her voice steady despite the turmoil of emotions within her. Turning to Andromeda, turning to face her with a furrowed brow, "What's a magical guardian?" Andromeda's gaze softened as she took a step closer to Harriet, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.
-"A magical guardian, dear, is the person the wizarding world recognizes as responsible for you, especially when your own parents aren't around." She paused; her eyes filled with understanding. "In most cases, it's a parent or a tutor, but for someone like you, a muggleborn with no living relatives in the wizarding world, it's someone else the Ministry of Magic appoints. It's usually a trusted magical individual who ensures your safety and well-being." Her voice was firm but gentle, offering support while explaining the complexities of her new reality.
Harriet caught the smug look on Brodkrat's face, knowing she had caught the inconsistency in Andromeda's story. She took a deep breath, her eyes flashing with a hint of the fire.
-"Andromeda, I think there's something you've left out," she said, her voice measured and firm. "You said like muggleborn, like me, but that's not true. Both of my parents are magical." She turned to Brodkrat, her temper simmering just below the surface. "Tell me, Brodkrat, who is my magical guardian?" The air grew tense, the silence a testament to the gravity of her question. The flickering torchlight cast shadows that danced across the walls, mirroring the tumult of thoughts and feelings within her. She knew the answer could change a lot of things.
Andromeda felt a surge of tension in the room, the very air thick with the magic that seemed to crackle around Harriet. Her eyes narrowed as she noticed the girl's temper flaring up, the magic in the air becoming palpable. Concern etched on her face, she spoke with urgency, "I need to fetch something," she announced. She swiftly made her way out of the chamber, before hurrying to the infirmary to grab a calming draught for Harriet, her mind racing with the implications of what she had just heard.
As Brodkrat's smile grew into a proud smirk, he nodded in approval. "Sharp as ever, flower's daughter," he said, his eyes gleaming with a hint of mischief. "But as Gringotts Inquisitor, my duty is to protect the bank's interests, not to inquire too deeply into the matters of wizarding law. I had to look for your guardian to notify him about the situation of his charge, and whatever I found, I'm duty bound to not inquiry further into wizard status... but as your new steward, it is within my purview to inform you about ... oversight of my predecessor... A magical guardian is indeed a figure of authority in young magical life. it is someone who his granted legal responsibility for your well-being. Given your unique circumstances, with your true identity concealed, the guardianship of Harry James Potter, by ministerial decision, was assumed by albus Dumbledore." his gaze shrewd as he studied her reaction."
Brodkrat's smile faded, his expression growing stern as he spoke with the gravity of one who knew the ancient laws by heart. "Flower's daughter, the truth is that our kind, the goblins, we do not involve ourselves in the squabbles of wizards and their politics. We are bound by the unyielding laws of magic and blood, not by the fleeting whispers of human alliances." His eyes searched hers, a silent challenge. "
As the implications of Brodkrat's words sank in, Harriet felt the room closing around her.
-"What are you saying?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. The shadows cast by the flickering torch danced across the goblin's face, painting it in a sinister light. Brodkrat leaned in closer, his eyes never leaving hers.
-"The claim of guardianship was for Harry Potter, never Harriet," he continued, his voice a low rumble that seemed to echo through the very stones of the chamber. "With the help of your late account manager, those claims were left unverified." His gaze flickered down to the parchments, then back up to her. "It seems that someone had an interest in keeping it that way."
The silence grew thick, the crackling of the torches the only sound in the room as the truth of her situation dawned upon her. "The oversight of your previous guardianship claim is something we cannot ignore. It was a grave mistake, one that has left a stain upon our record. But" he continued, "my predecessor was bribed, and he let this... claim slip through the cracks, allowing it to affect your trust vault. We will not be party to such deceit. If you want, you may remain under our protection until your rightful guardianship is restored." The air grew thick with tension as the weight of his words sank in, the shadows cast by the torches dancing on their faces as if to emphasize the gravity of the situation.
Brodkrat continued, his voice a low rumble in the stillness of the chamber. "From the moment you chose my office to have your impromptu little nap, I've been digging through our records, through my contact within the ministry and even within the muggle authority, and what I've found, or rather, what I haven't found, has left me quite disturbed." He paused, the silence stretching like a tightly drawn bowstring. "The paperwork for your guardianship is... troubling, to say the least." His gaze grew shrewd as he studied her reaction, the torchlight casting a harsh glow on his face, revealing the lines etched by years of dealing with the treacheries of the wizarding world.
Andromeda strode back into the chamber, her arms laden with bottles of Calming Draught. She could feel the tempest of emotions brewing within Harriet, a storm that could not be ignored. Her eyes searched the girl's tightly controlled expression, recognizing the mask she had worn herself in times of distress. "Here, drink this," she said, her voice firm but filled with concern as she offered a bottle to Harriet. "You'll need it." With careful precision, she placed the bottles on the nearest table, ensuring they were within easy reach. She knew that the revelation of her true guardianship. Andromeda took a deep breath, fearing what she was about to learn about her own family. she drowned one of the vial herself with trembling hands.
"Thank you," Harriet replied to Brodkrat, her voice calm despite the tumult of emotions threatening to overwhelm her. "I appreciate your honesty, and I understand your position. But I need to know the truth." She took a deep breath, her eyes never leaving the goblin's, focused on something else to take the time to compose herself again before they delve into the main subject again. "What happened to my previous account manager?" She asked, her curiosity piqued by the implication of bribery.
The room remained still, the only sound the crackling of the torches, the air charged with the promise of revelation. Brodkrat's smile grew predatory, his teeth sharpening as he spoke.
-"Your previous account manager has been..." his voice a low purr that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the chamber. "...shortened"
The goblin's eyes gleamed with a hint of amusement, the corners of his mouth twitching upwards as he enjoyed Andromeda shock, her gasp echoed through the chamber, a stark reminder of the tension that had built up between the three of them. Harriet turned to her, her eyes filled with a determination that had not been there before.
-"good." Harriet looked seriously at Brodkrat.
Andromeda's eyes widened in horror at the goblin's words, but she quickly composed herself. She knew that the world of magic was not always kind, she turned to Harriet, her gaze filled with concern.
-"Dear," she said, her voice softer now, "try not to let anger guide your words. You've come so far, and you mustn't let anger your future." Her hand squeezed Harriet's shoulder briefly, offering silent comfort.
Harriet said, her eyes never leaving andromeda, her voice tightly controlled, "Graglast broke goblin law, and he paid the price for it. I didn't wish for his punishment, but he made his choices. He was an instrument in keeping me in the dark, leaving me to rot with my relatives." Her jaw clenched at the mention of the Dursleys. " I do understand the gravity of this situation, But I won't mourn him."
The chamber grew quiet again, the crackling of the torches the only sound that pierced the silence.
Brodkrat's expression remained stoic as he spoke again, his eyes flicking between the two witches. "We must focus on the matter at hand." His gaze turned to Harriet, his voice taking on a more serious tone, showing her a sheet of parchment. "The matter of your contact at the ministry have been searching for anything related to Harriet Jasmin Potter since we have been made award of your true identity. The lack of proper documentation suggests a deliberate attempt to obscure your true identity. The Ministry's records are not infallible, and it is not unheard of for someone trying to manipulate them. But it is curious that only this receipt." He tapped the paper with a clawed finger, the sound echoing through the chamber like a drumbeat of impending trouble. "It seems that a receipt of testimony of godparenthood was all that was found. But it is troubling, very troubling... This could have dire consequences for not just you, but for all those connected to you." He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. "It appears that your parents had the foresight to appoint guardians for you, but it is most disturbing that both have found themselves unable to step forward to take custody, soon after your parents' departure from this world."
-"What was the name on the receipt of testimony?" Harriet's voice was a mix of curiosity and anxiety. Her eyes searched Brodkrat's face, trying to read the goblin's thoughts. She had never had godparents that she knew of, not since she had been living with the Dursleys. The revelation of this potential connection to her past felt like a glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak world. The torchlight cast flickering shadows on her face, highlighting the tension in her features as she awaited his response.
-"I should start chronologically with the fact I could verify during last week... Our records indicate that your grandparent passed away in February 1981, leaving your father as the last known Potter heir, barely 8 months before his own departure. as the ministry doesn't have record of muggle family, we don't have information regarding your mother's lineage." The goblin paused,
Brodkrat's eyes remained focused on the parchment, his expression inscrutable. "The receipt of testimony for godparenthood bears the name of Sirius Orion Black and Alice Longbottom." Harriet felt a sudden warmth spread through her chest, a feeling of belonging that had been missing for so long. "Their testimony was given on your first birthday the 31 July 1981," he continued, "But the records of your guardianship are missing." The gravity of the situation settled upon them like a heavy shroud.
Andromeda's eyes searched the room, blurred slightly by the calming draught. She took a shaky breath, feeling the weight of the revelation pressing down upon her. Despite the potion's calming effects, tears slipped down her cheeks. "This is..." she trailed off, her mind racing with thoughts of her cousin. Her hand hovered over the bottle, unsure whether to offer it to Harriet or hold on to it herself. "Harriet," she began, her voice trembling, "you shouldn't be too hopeful..."
-"Andromeda, please," Harriet interrupted gently, her eyes never leaving Brodkrat's. "I need to know the truth, no matter how painful it might be." Her gaze was unwavering, a silent plea for the goblin to continue.
Brodkrat nodded solemnly, acknowledging the gravity of the situation. "The records we found are... inconsistent." He paused, choosing his words with care. "Sirius Black, named as your godfather, was arrested and sent to Azkaban on the first of November, the very day following the tragic events at Godric's Hollow." His expression grew thoughtful as he tapped a long, clawed finger against his chin. "There's no evidence of a trial or even a preliminary inquiry. Just... an arrest." The flickering torchlight cast an eerie glow across the parchments sin his hand, emphasizing the shadows that danced across their faces. "If you wish to understand the wizard side of this, perhaps Healer Tonks would be able to provide insight into the Wizarding world's perspective on this matter." His gaze lingering on the two women as he awaited their next move, the room suffused with the heavy silence that follows a revelation that shatters the very foundation of their reality.
Andromeda swallowed hard, the calming draught barely taking the edge off the dread coiling in her stomach. "We've all heard whispers," she began, her voice carrying the weight of the past. "The Potters went into hiding and then...And Harry Potter... he's the one who defeated Voldemort?" she trailed off, her thoughts racing back to that fateful night. "They were betrayed, and padfoot... he was accused, sent to Azkaban." She paused, her eyes brimming with unshed tears.
Harriet was about to explode "are you telling me padfoot is Sirius?". The realization of the significance of Sirius' fate hitting her like a ton of bricks. Her hand clenched into a fist, the anger and betrayal she felt at the mention of her godfather's imprisonment.
Andromeda barely nodded. "Sirius was always a rebel... but our family was as dark as his name... he is my cousin..." she murmured.
-"Then it seems the wizarding world has made another mistake," Harriet said, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. She took a deep breath, composing herself before speaking, "My mother's letter say that he took a vow, one that would prevent him from betraying or harming me. If Alice Longbottom took a similar vow... Can you tell me more about her?" She directed her question to Brodkrat, her eyes searching his for answers, her posture unyielding in the dimly lit chamber.
Before Brodkrat could answer, Andromeda spoke, still under the influence of the calming draught in a tone that was almost detached, as if recounting a story she had heard rather. "Alice Longbottom is in the Janus Thickey Ward for Spell Damage, with her husband, Frank. They have been there since the attack in early November 1981." She paused, her gaze drifting to the flickering shadows on the wall, her thoughts a tumult of memories and regrets. "They were tortured by Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters, leaving them in a... compromised state."
Harriet temper, having been simmering beneath the surface, began to rise again. "How convenient," she murmured, her voice laced with sarcasm. The flicker of anger in her eyes grew stronger, a silent challenge to the goblin and his cryptic words. "Tomorrow, I'll see Moon and Bear, they are Cassandra and Caroll kids. Perhaps they'll have more information about Moony, and what happened to them all."
She turned to Brodkrat, her eyes a storm of determination. "Now, you have a lead," she said, her voice steady and unwavering. "Can you dig into the Sirius situation? Find out more about what happened, and why the records are so... conveniently incomplete? and why an innocent man is still in jail?" The edge in her voice was palpable, the weight of her words heavy with the promise of further investigation.
Brodkrat nodded gravely, his expression a blend of understanding and respect for the fierce determination in Harriet's eyes. "I shall leave you, I shall begin my research into this matter immediately." He stood up from his chair. The goblin's eyes glinted in the flickering light as he met their gazes, one final time, before exiting the chamber, the heavy oak door closing behind him with a thud that seemed to resonate through the very core of the bank.
