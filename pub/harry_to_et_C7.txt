around 6pm, Andromeda rises with a yawn, stretching out her cramped muscles.
-"It's time for me to leave, Harriet," she says, her voice a gentle caress. "I will come back in the morning. don't stay up too late you need to rest." With a lingering gaze, she exits the room. As the door clicks shut, Harriet is once again alone with her thoughts.
Once Andromeda leaves, Harriet takes a moment to let the silence of the room wrap around her. She runs her fingers over the diary, feeling the warmth of the leather cover beneath her fingertips. Her thoughts swirl around the events of the day: the folder, Graglast's visit, the clothes from Andromeda, and the meeting with Brodkrat, Grimbold, and Gornuk. 
Suddenly, a memory flits through her mind like a shooting star, illuminating the dusty corners of her thoughts. "The box," she murmurs aloud. "Brodkrat bring the box that belonged to my mother when he came this morning." Her eyes widen with excitement.
She turned her gaze to the little carved box standing patiently on her bedside table, a silent sentinel of the secrets it contained. With a deep breath, she gently picked it up and placed it beside her on the bed. The candlelight cast shadows that danced across its intricate surface, hinting at the mysteries within. "It doesn’t hurt to try" she wonders, her heart racing with a mix of anticipation and trepidation. 
Carefully, she took a piece of parchment they had been using earlier to study and scribbled a tentative "hello" with the quill, her hand shaking slightly. She placed it in the box, her eyes never leaving the dark interior.
As she closed the lid, she heard a faint rustling, like a whisper in the quiet room. With a sense of wonder, she lifted the lid again, only to find the paper had vanished without a trace. "Here goes my bottle to the sea..." she whispered to herself, her voice barely a breath in the stillness.
After a few moments of silence, she set the box down, her thoughts racing. She decided to wait for a response, her eyes glued to the box. Five minutes ticked by, the candle flame casting a solitary dance of light and shadow across the cold stones of the infirmary wall. Still, nothing happened. She sighed, her gaze lingering on the box. "I suppose they're busy," she murmured. "They will have to notice I send something... if they still have their box" The flicker of hope in her eyes remained, a beacon in the enveloping darkness of uncertainty.
Feeling the weight of a book one runes in her hand, she opened it to a random page, her eyes scanning over the old scripting. It was like reading a story written in a language she had once spoken fluently but had since forgotten, the words and symbols swimming before her eyes.
With a sigh, she leaned back against the pillows, the candlelight playing across her face. "I guess it's just you and me for now," she said to the book, her voice a whisper in the hush of the night. She felt a strange comfort in the ancient runes, a reminder of a mother she had never truly known, but whose presence was as palpable as the ink on the diary, a silent witness to her mother's life, became a gateway to the past, and perhaps, a guide for her own future.
She began to cross-read, the book about rune and the diary, her eyes moving slowly over the text, her mind piecing together the puzzle of her heritage one word at a time.
"Thanks to today's lesson from Andromeda," she murmured, "I can actually understand what you're talking about, Mum." She traced the words with her fingertip, her eyes shining with a mix of wonder and sadness. The candles cast a warm glow over her, a stark contrast to the cold reality of her situation. The diary was a lifeline to her mother's world, and she clung to it, feeling a little less alone in the vast, mysterious tapestry of her new life.
After what felt like hours of reading, she finally heard the soft rustle of the box. She picked it up with trembling hands, her heart racing in anticipation.
Opening the lid, she found the two parchments, the one she had sent but someone added a small neatly written "hello, box" and another with the hasty scrawl of letters "Hello," it read, the script tentative and unfamiliar. "Who are you?"
Harriet's thoughts raced as she held the parchments with the unfamiliar handwriting. She knew she had to tread carefully to know what happen without saying too much.
she writ on a new parchment big enough for everyone to writ on it "I am Blossom," she wrote with a firm, deliberate hand, trying to match the steadiness of the original message. "My mother, Flower, left this box for me. I was looking to talk with Cassandra and Carroll. I know you're not them, but could you help me?"
She placed the parchment back into the box, her heart thumping in her chest as she waited for a response. The flickering candlelight painted a dance of shadows on the walls, each one a silent story of its own.

The parchment fluttered back up almost immediately, the script now more assured. "I am sorry, Blossom," it read. "I do not know Cassandra or Caroll, for this was my mother's box. Perhaps she could have helped, but she has left us," it said, a note of sorrow echoing through the written words. Harriet's heart sank at the realization, but she felt a strange kinship with the unknown writer.
The other scrawl scripting was more carefully written this time "I am sorry for your loss. i don't know those names neither" she could the few scratched out lines, the person tried to writ before settling to the simplest one.
she could guess the other writers was as young as her even maybe more for sure the second one was even more timid than her.
Taking a deep breath, she felt a pang of regret for not being able to meet the person she was reaching out to "I’m sorry, my mom is gone too. but I know she loved me really much and I’m sure yours did too. it's not safe to give our real names to strangers but by any chance did your moms called you moon and bear?" thinking about the nickname Cassandra and carol have named they babies in her mom’s diary.
the answer she receives was even faster. "Yes," the reply came, the words etched with a pain that mirrored the droplets of ink that looked suspiciously like tears. "My mother called me 'her little Moon'." 
While bear scribbled "my gran told me told me that's what they used to call me when I was a baby, how do you know about our nicknames?" The parchment lay still, the candlelight dancing shadows across the page, as if holding its breath for Harriet's response. The room felt heavier with the weight of the unspoken truths, the stones of the infirmary walls seemingly leaning closer to listen.
"In my mother's diary," she wrote slowly, her hand trembling slightly, "Cassandra was calling her daughter 'moon' and Caroll was calling his son 'bear' because her husband brought a teddy bear to him and made a joke about their son making 'bear hugs'." She paused, the tip of her quill hovering above the parchment as she considered her next words. "My mother she was friends with them. Maybe that’s connected somehow." She placed the parchment back into the box, her heart racing with the realization that she might not be as alone as she had once thought. The candlelight flickered, casting a warm glow on the pages of the diary.
As the candles cast long shadows across the ancient stones of the infirmary, Harriet felt a strange kinship with the unseen writer. The quiet whispers of the parchment in the box grew more frequent, the words exchanged becoming more personal and revealing.
It was as if the very walls of the chamber were weaving an intricate tapestry of secrets and long-lost connections. The glow of the candles grew dimmer, but the warmth of the moment filled the room with an unexpected light.
this time they were only moon reply, it seems bear was pondering what's happening. "But my mom's name was Pandora," moon scribbled back. "And she talked about her friends, Lily and Alice." As she read moon words, her first reaction was, O gosh, this one is naive... and then it hit her, she groaned she couldn't help but feel a twinge of annoyance at their mothers playfulness with names. It was a reminder of the woman she had never truly known, and yet, felt so close to in these moments.
She sighed and replied, "Another lucky guess, would happen that your mother is a seer?" She couldn't help the hint of scepticism in her mind, the weight of the secrets they were uncovering pressing down on her shoulders. The candles flickered in the silence that followed, their shadows playing across her face as she waited for a response. The diary, with their mothers’ banters, remained open beside her, a silent testament to the complex web of destinies and deceits that had led her here.
this time bear replied too. moon was starting "How do you know that?" she asked, her voice carrying the weight of the revelation. "It's written in your mom's diary too?" She studied the parchment, her heart pounding in her chest. as bear write, "would it be alright if I maybe look at your mom’s diary? Only if you’re okay with it" they were a lot of crossed word again. Harriet was wondering how hard it must have been for him to write it, yet it seems that shy boy was as desperate as her to know more about his parents. 
"It's not written in the diary, Moon," Harriet began. "It's just that... well, Cassandra is a seer from Greek mythology, and Pandora is also a mythological figure known for her curiosity. And, you know, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is written by Lewis Carroll." She paused, her heart racing. "Our moms had a sense of humour, didn't they? Bear, I'd love for you to read it we could go through it together. but you'll have to come at Gringotts and it's a safe place to meet, just let me know I’ll tell the goblins first to let you in" Her hand was steady as she placed the parchment in the box, a silent promise of unity and protection. 
She started to read again waiting for their answers when the goblin nurse, entered the room with a tray laden with a light meal of greens and a refreshing beverage, the flicker of candlelight danced across the pages of the diary. The scent of fresh mint and a hint of magic filled the air, a stark contrast to the heaviness of their conversation. Harriet's stomach rumbled, a gentle reminder of the world outside.
Almost an hour had passed since Harriet had made her answer when she finally receive the parchment again. She couldn't help but smile at Moon's eagerness. "Could I come too? Daddy won't mind if I stand at Gringotts while he works." The words seemed to float off the parchment, full of hope and innocence. "The words were followed by a pause, the anticipation hanging in the air. The reply from Bear "I asked Gran," was followed by a neat scripting that was more deliberate this time, "who are you and what's your purpose with meeting my grandson?"
"Moon," Harriet wrote, her heart warming at the thought of the child's enthusiasm. "I'd love for you to come". "Granny bear, I can tell you my name, but you wouldn't probably believe me if I did, it's better if you come to and see me for yourself." she continued, her cheekiness showing when she felt she was pushed her hand steady despite the gravity of her words. "I found the diary, and it tells me our moms were friends. I want to know more about them, about us. I'll talk to the goblins about arranging a meeting. I’ll be delighted to see you both." She handed the parchment back into the box, feeling a strange sense of relief at the thought of sharing her burden with others who might understand.
With trembling hands, Harriet retrieved the parchment from the box, reading Moon's excited response, "Daddy told me we can come the day after tomorrow!" The childlike anticipation was palpable in the room. The second parchment followed, written in a firm, yet concerned script that could only belong to Granny Bear. "It is settled, then," the words read with a stern finality, "we will come the day after tomorrow as well. However, I forbid any further correspondence until we meet in person. Safety is paramount."
"Moon, I can't wait to meet you," she wrote, her voice filled with a gentle warmth that seemed to resonate through the very ink. "And Granny Bear, I understand your caution. The day after tomorrow it is. Tell Bear, I'll be waiting for you. Ask for 'Flower's Daughter' and they'll know who to let in." She folded the parchment neatly and placed it back into the box, feeling a mix of excitement and anxiety for the upcoming meeting.
Harriet couldn't help but smile at the thought of Moon's mother being named Pandora. It was as if their mothers had known, all those years ago, that they would find hope in these little boxes.
As she lay in her bed, the flicker of candlelight playing across her features, the weight of the day's revelations seemed to press down upon her. Yet, she couldn't help but smile as she thought of the innocent curiosity in Moon's words, the hope it brought to her heart. It had been a long, draining day, but for the first time in what felt like an eternity, she had something to look forward to - a connection to her mother, to a family she never knew existed. With a sigh of contentment, she closed her eyes, allowing sleep to claim her, her dreams filled with the warmth of newfound kinship and the promise of secrets soon to be unveiled.
