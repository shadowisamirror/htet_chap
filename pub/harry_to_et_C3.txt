The following dawn, after the tumultuous entry into Gringotts, Harriet Potter stirred within the enveloping warmth of her bed. Her eyes fluttered open.
 With a yawn, she sat up, she reaches for her glasses on her bedstead. the creaks of the aged bedstead echoing through the stillness of the room. The pile of books on her bedstead table, which had appeared overnight to a towering height.
she rubs her eyes and glances at the books "What could all these be about..."
Curiosity piqued, Harriet couldn't help but wonder about the origins of these tomes. she felt drawn to a torn leather-bound book who look like a diary, the cover feeling cool to the touch. With a gentle tug, she pulled it free from the precarious stack, sending a dusty whisper into the air.
 The book that lay open in her hands was unlike any she had seen before. Its pages were a tapestry of scribbled notes, spells, and doodles, a mix of different handwriting styles intertwined like vines upon the parchment. It was a research journal, but not just any journal. This was a living document of discovery, filled with the musings and jests of three distinct individuals. As she skimmed through the pages, her eyes danced over cryptic incantations and diagrams, her mind trying to piece together the puzzle of their scholarly banter.
Turning the pages, she stumbled upon an entry that seemed to be a conversation between the three scribes. Their banter was light, filled with humour that was lost on her. But the more she read, the more she felt a kinship with these unknown individuals, a bond forged through the shared love of magic.

Harriet looked up from the book, her mind racing. Flower, Cassandra, and Caroll as they call themselves—each had left their mark upon these pages, their personalities as distinct as the inks they used. Flower, the driving force, a master of runes with a sharp intellect that pierced through the veil of the arcane. Cassandra, a free spirit whose whimsical charm-work was as unpredictable as her one-line verses, always seeking to inspire and challenge. And Caroll, the grounded anchor, her knowledge of ancient magic a beacon that kept the others tethered to reality.
Their friendship, their complicity, their witty comment—it all sang to Harriet in a harmony that resonated deep within her. It was as if she were peering through a foggy window into the lives of those women.
Her thoughts grew introspective as she pondered over the trio's life, talking about the babies, their fear, their successes and their failures, all laid bare in the fading ink of this journal. It was a story of camaraderie, of striving for something greater than themselves, and it filled Harriet with a fierce determination to learn who was them and how this journal ended up in her hands.
As Harriet continued to delve into the diary, she stumbled upon a series of entries that spoke of an artifacts of great interest: three small, intricately carved boxes that had been in the possession of each of them. Those box, they wrote with hushed excitement, was based on the ancient concept of vanishing cabinets—a magical device capable of connecting places. It seems they used those boxes to pass the diary between them at certain point of time.
maybe if a box was in her safe with the diary, she could try to use it and reach for them. it was a bottle in the see but it's she could do from her bed.

Harriet was brought of her musing by the door to her chamber creaking open, revealing Healer Grimbold standing alongside a woman with a fiery mane of hair and piercing grey eyes. She had an air of confidence and warmth that seemed to fill the room.
-"Miss potter," Grimbold announced with a small smile, "I’m glad you enjoy reading, we took the liberty to withdraw those books from your trunk and vault.”
- “yes, thank you, I won’t get bored anytime soon with those...”
Grimbold give a curt node to Harriet before continuing This is Andromeda Tonks. She's been assigned as your personal helper during your stay with us." Andromeda offered a curt nod too, her eyes scanning Harriet with a mix of curiosity and concern.
-"Andromeda will assist you in your daily activities and provide companionship," he continued, his tone gentle yet firm. "Her experience and discretion are invaluable to us here." Harriet looked up, a mix of surprise and apprehension crossing her features.
Harriet felt a knot in her stomach, she didn’t event noticed, loosen slightly at his reassurance.
-"thank you for the books, everything I say, everything we talk about, it's... private?" she asked, her voice tentative.
-"Absolutely," Grimbold affirmed. "Your contract with her is ironclad. Not even the most persuasive wizard or which can coerce her into breaking secrecy." He paused, his gaze meeting hers. "Even if it's not directly related to your health, what you share with her stays within these walls. The only exceptions are matters of immediate danger or harm to you or Gringotts." He gave her a solemn nod. "You can trust her implicitly." With those words, Harry felt a weight lifted from her shoulders. The assurance of confidentiality allowed her to feel relieved.
Grimbold continued “she’ll start officially tomorrow but I thought, making her acquaintance yearly would be better. I’ll let you get acquitted with each other.” As Grimbold prepared to leave, he reminded her, "I shall return tomorrow to review your progress and discuss any further developments. In the meantime, I encourage you to rest and recover».
-“Grimbold, sorry to bother you but, could you ask someone to look in my vault for this box?” she shows him a sketch in the journal “I’m stuck in the bed but if it’s there, could I have it please?”
 With a final nod, he swept out of the room, leaving Harry and Andromeda in the quiet embrace of the flickering candlelight.
She looked at Harry, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief.
-"So, you're my new boss?" she quipped, trying to lighten the atmosphere. "I must admit, I was a tad surprised when St Mungo's said I had to take an indefinite leave, and for what? To come down here and babysit a young witch." Her laugh was warm and genuine.
-"But now I see why the secrecy and a young with under the law of Gringotts’s, that could start a new goblin war if things get messy." She stepped closer, her gaze searching Harry's eyes. -"I'm here to help in any way you need, not just with the physical but the... well, the messier bits of life too." She paused, her expression growing more serious. "Whatever you're dealing with, we can talk about it. I've seen enough of the world's ugliness to know when someone's carrying more than their fair share." She reached out a hand, offering a gentle touch of camaraderie.

Harry nodded, feeling a flicker of relief at the goblin's endorsement. She had become accustomed to adults dismissing her, but there was something different about Andromeda. Her eyes searched the woman's face, looking for any sign of deceit or condescension. Finding none, she spoke in a subdued voice. "What did they tell you?"
-"Only that a young witch needed assistance, and I was the one for that," Andromeda replied, "I didn't know why, but I guess you’re a metamorphomagus?" She offered a small, understanding smile. -"Whether it's the spells that make you feel unwell or the weight of secrets that you might be carrying, I'm here to listen and offer support." Her gaze was sincere and empathetic, the lines around her eyes crinkling with kindness.
- “yes, something like that, I didn’t know I was until I pass through that waterfall...”
At that andromeda gaze grew concerned, and quickly come near the bed to start examining Harriet “you pass through that? What did they do to you? How are you feeling? No headache? Do you feel dizzy...”
Harriet placates her dismissively not used to someone so caringly demonstrative “I’m good really, just a bit itching. they just told me to stay in bed until I’m accustomed to my real body, how did you find out I’m metamorphomagus?”
Andromeda took out a little make up mirror from her handbag “you look like my daughter when she was 3 and her ability woke up..” she open her mirror and show Harriet her reflection her face was morphing slightly, but she could see her eyes they were deep emerald green before but now they were piercing bright green like the colour you could see in fireworks.
Harriet start ed blushing at her own reflecting gazing at her, her skin starting to turn redder. 
Andromeda took off her mirror snorting “don’t look like that, I’ll think you never saw yourself in a mirror.”
Harriet looks at her realising the gobbling told her nothing about her condition, to let her choose what she wants to reveal nothing more “well actually, I thought I was a boy until the 31... I didn’t know magic was real until that day...” andromeda was so shocked she had sat in the chair next to Harriet bed as Harriet continued. "I guess I should start from the beginning, then," she murmured. -"It was Hagrid who told me I was a “wizard”, and he brought me here to Diagon alley. And since then, it's been a... a whirlwind." She took a moment, gathering her thoughts, and then continued "I've been living as a boy in the Muggle world” She start to explain all the events of the previous days. -"They found out who I really am when I came back to Gringotts... You're the only one they thought I could trust with all of this." Her words hung in the air, a poignant confession that seemed to echo the whispers of the ancient stones around them.
Andromeda sat here looking paler as the implication of her new job of her new job mean sinking  in her mind racing trying to make sense of everything she’s hearing from Harriet, as a black she  have been taught to look at the ensemble and she doesn’t like what she’s hearing and far less make sense of everything “excuse me, I think we should have started there.. but can you tell me your name?” thinking asking something simple would let her the time to recompose herself.
Harriet looked sheepishly at andromeda “Oh…yes, sorry, I’m Harriet Potter.”
Andromeda looked flabbergasted “sorry... you mean potter like, Harry Potter?”
- “yeah, that’s what they called me... but actually it’s Harriet jasmine Potter...” she looked worryingly at andromeda who was now white as a ghost “are you ok?”
- “I... I think I need to think over this... I’ll see you tomorrow andromeda said weakly, slowly standing and unsteadily out of the room.
- “okay...” Harriet watched a little disappointed at andromeda reaction, but again she knew she can’t rely on adult. She just shrugged and started to read the diary again.

Harriet felt the weight of the book grow heavier as the banter of the trio's entries grew less frequent. With each page she turned, the mood of their entries grew more solemn, the humour and lightness replaced with urgency and dread. At the end of one particularly long and cryptic entry, the ink grew darker, the letters more forceful. They were discussing something called "soul magic," a topic that sent a chill down her spine.
The trio spoke of protecting themselves against an something they called "AK" It was clear they were facing a grave threat, one that had the power to alter the very fabric of their existence. And amidst their strategies and spells, there were whispers of a prophecy—a foretelling of events that had not yet happened but weighed heavily upon them like a shroud.
Her eyes widened in shock as she realized the gravity of what she was reading. This was not mere gossip or the musings of scholars; this was the chronicle of a battle against the very essence of evil, and she had been granted a rare glimpse into their world.

As Harriet reached the latter pages of the journal, she found a series of entries where Flower's handwriting grew frantic. The air in the room grew thick with tension as she read about the ancient ritual of the Sol Rune. 
Flower's research into the ancient protection ritual, one that involved the sol rune. The symbol itself was drawn with meticulous detail, the intricate lines seemingly pulsing with power, it's looked exactly like her scar on her forehead, she reached for it instinctively, tracing the partner that have been burning since she passed through the cold waterfall.
The other two had scribbled furiously around the edges, their fear palpable through the parchment. "Too dangerous," one had written. "The cost is too high," another had warned. Yet, Flower's determination was unwavering.
As she studied the symbol, Harriet could almost hear the echoes of their arguments—Cassandra's pleas for caution, Caroll's insistence that they explore every possible alternative, and Flower's fierce conviction that this was the only way to protect her baby she has been calling blossom in the diary.

At the very last entry, Harriet felt her eyes grow misty. Cassandra's handwriting, once so playful and whimsical, had taken on a serious tone. "We will overcome this," she had written, her words a declaration of hope amidst the despair. Caroll's message was more succinct, a simple "Good luck" etched with a tremble of the quill, as if she knew she might never see her friends again. But it was Flower's final words that brought a tear to Harriet's eye. In a script that had grown thin and weary, she had penned her farewell, her love and friendship spilling forth in a tapestry of ink. "Should we be parted," she wrote, "know that I hold you both in the highest regard. May the stars shine upon our reunion."

At the very back of the diary, a folded parchment lay hidden, tucked between the pages like a secret message lost in time. With trembling hands, Harriet carefully unfolded the brittle paper, revealing the delicate script of a mother's love.
-"To my beautiful, lovely daughter," it began,
" I wish I wouldn't have to write it at all, but it seems fate choose otherwise. I can't say too much, just in case someone try to meddle, but know that I love you more than anything. if you ever feel something isn't right trust your instinct. love may be the greatest power but remember even log fire would burn you and ice could freeze you to death, but it can be used to make the ice cream you love so much.
I’ll hope everything worked out for the better but otherwise if you need support look for Cassandra, Carroll or even padfoot they took an oath they can’t betray you, even going against your will could hurt them.
I wish we had more time, know that whatever I love you in this life and beyond,
your mother, lily"
Harriet couldn't hold back the sobs anymore. She clutched the diary and the letter to her chest, her heart feeling as if it might shatter from the weight of the revelation. But amidst the grief, there was a spark of hope, a flicker of strength that grew with every beat. Her mother's love, preserved in ink, had found its way to her. She was not alone in this world, not truly. 
after that Harriet could stop crying herself to sleep, holding the diary and the letter against her chest.
