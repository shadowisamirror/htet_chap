Chapter 1: the wrong train
-"Shit.." Harry murmured under his breath as he stared at the train chart, his eyes tracing back over the name of the station he had just read. "I can't believe I got on the wrong bloody train," he muttered, his voice a mix of disbelief and frustration. Hagrid put him in the wrong train, just his luck.

He leaned back against the cold metal wall of the subway car, sitting on his trunk with hedwig cage, surrounded by passengers lost in newspapers and coffee, indifferent to his silent frustration. As always, he was on his own.

-"Looks like I'll be getting off at the next stop and heading back to Diagon Alley," Harry thought to himself, his eyes flicking to the clock overhead, thinking his relatives will be mad if he come back after dinner time...

The pouch of galleons in his pocket felt like a lead weight. He rubbed the coarse fabric, considering his dwindling options.
Theyre already furious might as well make it eyed the passing streets through the train window. Maybe I can find a hotel and lie low. His stomach grumbled, but he was used to the hunger, the need for a safe place to think was more urgent."I need to dodge the Dursleys' wrath," he whispered, his heart racing at the thought of facing their anger once again.

Harry stepped off the train. The doors shut behind him with a final clang, sealing his decision. "Alright," Harry said, his voice a mix of resignation and determination. "I know I can't pay for a room with this," he jingled the pouch of wizard gold, "not in this world anyway." He stepped off the train. Londons evening chill greeted him as he walked the gritty platform.

-"I guess I'll have to find a place in Diagon Alley," Harry thought, The thrill of freedom and avoiding the dursley making him giddy as he walk outside in the London streets in the evening to go back to the leaky couldron. He could never rely on adults anyway, so he know he can take care of himself

His eyes locking onto the distant speck of light that signaled the Leaky Cauldron's location. He took a deep breath, his eyes narrowing in resolve, and headed towards the hidden pub, the gateway to the wizarding world where he hope to find an escape from the abusive environment of the dursley.

Remembering the reaction of the wizard early at his scar, He instinctively tugged Dudleys oversized hoodie lower over his forehead, the itch of the fabric a small price for anonymity. He messed up his already messy hair to cover the lightning-shaped mark as best he could.

Cant risk being recognized, he mumbled. He paused before the pub, heart pounding. Then, with a murmurHere goes nothinghe slipped inside.

The air inside was thick with the scent of roasting meats and spilled butterbeer. Harry moved swiftly toward the back exit, avoiding eye contact, hand gripping his trunk tightly.

He stepped into the back court and pulled out his wand, remembering Hagrids instructions,"Just tap it like this."He tapped the wall three times with the tip of his wand, the cool stone vibrating slightly under his touch. The wall shivered and then slid aside to reveal the entrance of diagon alley.

Harry breathed, his eyes widening at the sight of the magical shops and people bustling about. He stepped through the archway, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he left the muggle world he had to stay cautious. his hand reflexively reaching for the hood of his sweatshirt. The last thing he needed was to be recognized.

-"Gringotts should be a good start I can left my stuff in my safe " Harry thought his heart racing with excitement and anxiety. He weaved through the cobbled street. He approached the grand entrance of Gringotts, his steps echoing through the alley a moment to compose himself, then enter the building.

He waited patiently in line, his eyes darting around, searching for a teller who looked less busy and more likely to be understanding of his situation. As he approached the counter, he felt the weight on his heart, goblins are scary.

-"I need to get to my vault but I don't have my key" Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm and even. "Could you help me?"

The teller left an eyebrow, his gaze lingering briefly on Harry's concealed apparence. the goblin said, his tone sharp and disbelieving. "You're telling me, wizard-whoever-you-are," the creature's voice dripped with skepticism, "that you've lost the very key that is entrusted to your care?"

The goblin's eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Harry like he was a suspicious character in a tale of wizarding crime. Technically harry know its hagrid who have his key but its faster to explain it that way, so he just nodded.

-"Know this," the goblin continued, his voice like the clink of gold coins, "Gringotts does not take lightly to the loss of its property. If indeed you've misplaced your key, it'll cost you dearly: 10 galleons for the fine, 5 for the replacement, and a rather... unpleasant verification process to prove your identity." The goblin's gaze hardened, his clawed hands resting on the countertop. "And should we discover you're trying to deceive us," he warned, his voice low and ominous, "you won't be leaving this bank so easily. Are you quite certain you've lost your key?"

Harry gulped, his throat suddenly dry as dust. He nodded, his eyes wide with fear and hope. "Yes" he murmured

-"Very well," the goblin said, his tone shifting to one of cold tapped a rune hidden beneath his desk with a sharp nail, and with a low growl, a massive, armored goblin warrior emerged from the shadows. The warrior's eyes bore into Harry, his expression a mask of intimidation.

The teller stated firmly, his sharp gaze never leaving Harry. "Until the verification process is complete, your wand is confiscated under Gringotts law. Any attempt to retrieve it will be met with severe consequences. Go to this room." The teller gestured to the side, where a hidden door opened to reveal a small, dimly lit chamber.

Harry swallowed hard, his heart racing. He had been through worse, but the directness and strictness of the goblins were unnerving. He knew he had to Abid by the system here, even if it meant facing a bit of fear. With a nod to the goblin, he stepped into the chamber, his eyes adjusting to the low light. He felt the weight of the situation pressing down on him.

In the dimly lit chamber, the stone walls seemed to close in around Harry as he faced the goblin behind the desk. The creature's eyes gleamed with an inquisitive look, his sharp teeth bared in a sneer.

-"What do we have here, a lost little lamb, or perhaps a wolf in sheep's clothing?" the goblin taunted. The air grew thick with tension, and Harry's palms grew slick with sweat as he realized the gravity of his situation.

He was in the heart of the wizarding bank, surrounded by creatures described by hagrid as nasty creatures, with a warrior in arm behind him . The goblin's scrutiny was unrelenting, as if he could see through Harry's very soul. The room was cold, the only sound the echo of Harry's shallow breaths and the tick of an ancient clock, reminding him that time was slipping away.

Harry took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving the goblin's. "I'm not a thief," he said, his voice firm despite the quiver of anxiety in his chest. "The teller told me I have to follow the procedure to prove my identity, and I didn't claim to be anyone." he added, his voice cracking slightly. He felt the sting of tears in his eyes but blinked them away, not wanting to show any weakness in this intimidating place. "Please, I'm Harry Potter, and I've come to get my things from my vault. How can i prove I'm telling the truth?"

The goblin's expression didn't change, but Harry felt a flicker of something in the air, a shift in the energy of the room. Perhaps, just perhaps, he had gotten through to the creature. He hoped so. His future depended on it.

The goblin's gaze remained fixed on Harry, his eyes narrowed. It was true that his job was to discern the truth from the countless falsehoods that wizards often tried to sell. And yet, there was something in the boy's eyes that spoke of sincerity, a desperation that seemed to resonate with his own experiences with those who had suffered. With a sigh, he leaned back in his chair, his clawed hands steepled before him.

-"Very well," the goblin said, his voice softer than before. "We shall begin the verification process. You're considered a temptative thief under gringots law, leave your belonging here, it's now gringots property until you're proving to be who you claim. But beware, boy-who-claim-to-be-Harry-Potter, if we find any trace of threat against gringots, you'll not like the result. The Falls of Thief shall be your first test."

The goblin standing an leading harry to a side door, and open to reveal a darkened corridor, the sound of rushing water echoing through it. "Follow me. But remember, any attempt to deceive us, and you shall face the consequences," he warned, his tone leaving no room for doubt.

The warrior goblin stepped aside, allowing Harry to pass. As they walked down the corridor, the sound of the water grew louder, and a cold, damp chill settled over him like a shroud. Harry took a deep breath his heart pounding in his chest. He had faced worse than this, he told himself.

-"Excuse me, sir," Harry said, his curiosity pushing through his fear. "Could you tell me your name?" The goblin paused, his eyes flickering with something that might have been amusement before he replied. "Brodkrat," the goblin said gruffly. "And I'd advise you to mind your manners, wizard. This is no place for idle chit-chat."

With that, Brodkrat led Harry through the doorway and into a vast cavern with a waterfall and stopped at the edge of the waterfall, the water shimmering with an eerie blue light as it cascaded down into the pool below. The rush of the water was deafening, the spray cool against Harry's face.

-"Walk through the waterfall and come back," Brodkrat instructed, his voice barely audible over the din. "The enchanted water will wash of any magic modifying your apparence or concelling your identity. If you don't use any disguise you shall pass unharmed."

The waterfall loomed before Harry, a wall of liquid crystal, sparkling in the dim light of the cavern. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay ahead. "Here goes," Harry thought, his heart racing as he took a tentative step forward, the roar of the water drowning out all other sounds. As he approached the base of the fall, the water grew colder, sending shivers down his spine. He closed his eyes and took one final step into the curtain of liquid ice.

He stumbled backward as the cold water of the falls washed over him, his hair plastered to his forehead as he emerged from the waterfall. Harry's stomach lurched, The taste of metal filled his mouth, and his stomach heaved. His heart racing as it feels his whole body revolting against the wash of magic working on him, Even all the beating he took from vernon and dudley his body was used to pain but it was every fiber of his body was twisted at the same time. "I'm okay," he assured Brodkrat, his teeth chattering. "Just the water... it's cold," he said with a forced chuckle, trying to lighten the mood.

His eyes searched the goblin's face for any sign of understanding or empathy, but found only scrutiny. Harry took a deep breath and straightened up, pushing the unpleasant sensation aside.

-"Pretended-mister-Harry-Potter," Brodkrat said, a hint of bemusement in his gruff voice. "For Metamorphmagus, this little bath have quite the dramatic effect. It doesn't help your case to hide such a things," he mused, watching Harry closely. "But, since you didn't try to look like someone else.. apart for the obvious... I'll let it slide." The goblin leaned closer, his eyes gleaming in the torchlight.

-"You see, in our society, young ones are quite precious, rare as dragon eggs. Any harm to a goblin child, and the perpetrator would be thrown to the dragons," he said, his tone serious. "So, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. Now, let's proceed to the procedure," Brodkrat said, gesturing toward the corridor to go back in his desk.

-"Metamorphomagus?" Harry echoed, his voice trembling slightly. "I don't know what you mean." He shivered, his teeth chattering not just from the cold but from the fear of being misunderstood, his eyes never leaving Brodkrat's.

-"Ah, so you didn't know," Brodkrat murmured, his sharp eyes studying Harry's reaction. "Interesting." He turned and led the way back to his desk, his mind racing with thoughts. Something about this one was... off. he could see the scheme brewing under the obvious magic currently working in this one . "Let's proceed with the verification," Brodkrat said, his tone still wary.

-"I'll go through whatever you need me to," Harry said with a firm nod, his voice a unsteady as his own body still revolting against himself feeling the magic of the waterfall.

-"You claim to be Harry Potter, yes?" He eyed Harry as he took his seat behind his desk once more, his long fingers tapping out a pattern on the ancient wood. "If that is true, then you're quite the... unique case." The goblin's expression remained unreadable, but Harry could feel his skepticism like a palpable force in the room.

-"But, as a precaution, I will have to report this to my superiors," Brodkrat said. Turning to the warior he said "this one is safe but it'll take more time you can go back to you post" With a flick of his wrist, he summoned a quill and a piece of parchment, ready to begin the process.

-"I swear," he added, his eyes meeting Brodkrat's, "I mean no harm to Gringotts or any of its inhabitants." The goblin's quill pause on the parchment, his gaze on Harry unwavering. "I just want to be safe, and I thought coming here was the best way to start that," Harry continued, his eyes pleading. He didn't dare mention the Dursleys or the trouble he'd left behind.

-"Tricky customers indeed," Brodkrat murmured to himself as he finished writing the parchment. It hovered in the air for a moment, as if contemplating its fate, before darting off through a small opening in the wall. The goblin took out a drawer and pulled out a small silver knife and two pieces of parchment, laying them before Harry.

-"You must sign these documents," he said, his voice firm. "if you are indeed who you claim, then they will reveal it. But beware, if you lie, the consequences will be severe. Prick the tip of your finger with the knife, let a drop of blood fall onto one of the parchment." he said, pushing the knife and the piece of parchment towards Harry.

Harry took a deep breath, his heart pounding. He took the knife, his hand trembling slightly. He pricked his own finger, feeling the brief sting, and watched as a single drop of blood welled up. Carefully, he let it fall onto both parchment, the crimson droplet stark against the creamy paper. As the droplets start to move takings shape of goblins scripture. He handed the parchment back to Brodkrat, his eyes never leaving the goblin's.

Brodkrat studied the parchments closely as the blood swirled and formed words on the parchment. He looked up at Harry, his expression unreadable. "This... is most unusual," he said slowly. "But the blood speaks truth." The goblin took out a magnifying glass and studied the parchments further. "You are indeed the sole heir of the potter family" he said finally, "But you are not Harry Potter.. you are a Harriet jasmine Potter. Daughter of James and Lily Potter." The room felt like it was spinning around Harry as the revelation sank in, his mind racing with questions and fear.

Harry's eyes widened in shock, and his hand, still holding the knife, began to shake violently. A high-pitched scream echoing through the chamber like a banshee's wail, realising it was is own voice, and why his body felt so weird and strange since he stepped out of the waterfall. As the revelation of being a girl hit him, the weight of his new reality became too much to bear. He collapsed to the floor, the knife clattering against the cold stone and the world grew dark around him.

Chapter 2: under Gringott's
Harriet's eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light, taking in the unfamiliar, yet comforting, surroundings. The ceiling, a masterpiece of ancient stonework, arched high above her, reminiscent of a drawing of the Moria she had once seen in a favourite book. Her heart raced, trying to piece together the puzzle of her recent experiences - the wrong train, her way back to Gringotts, the icy water of the falls of thief, and the revelation of her true identity. It was all too much to process at once. She swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in her throat, and whispered to herself, "What does this mean?"

A soft rustle drew her attention to the bedside. A goblin nurse hovered at the edge of her sight, eyes gleaming like obsidian beads. Her voice was soothing, yet every syllable sounded rehearsed

-"Miss Potter, please remain still. The physician and appropriate staff will be with you shortly to discuss your condition, Miss Potter," she assured, her tone professional.

Harriet's mind raced, trying to grasp the implications of being called "Miss Potter". The nurse's words brought a sudden realization of her vulnerability in this unfamiliar place.
At her words, a fresh wave of panic clutched Harriets ribcage. She tried to sit, but her limbs felt leaden. She nodded, complying with the instructions. How could she be a girl? She looked down at her trembling hands, the knuckles white from gripping the bedsheet tightly. Her thoughts swirled in a maelstrom of doubt and confusion, but she knew one thing for certain: she had to find out the truth.

Footsteps, deliberate, echoed through the hall. The heavy door groaned open to reveal three goblins, their features chiselled and stern. The first stepped forward:

a gaunt figure with eyes like polished steel. Brodkrat, the Inquisitor, she recalled, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through the stone. Behind him, a goblin in a pristine white robeGrimbold, head of Gringotts Medicinenodded curtly. The third, adorned in a fine tailored suit, identified himself as Graglast, the steward of the Potter family finances.

- "Miss Potter," Brodkrat intoned, each syllable measured, "we have questions regarding your condition. The doctor and I will require your full cooperation."
Harriets throat scraped raw as she croaked, "Why.. why am I called Miss?" she looks at them incredulously "How can I be a girl? I've been a boy my whole life..."

The goblin doctor cleared his throat, his expression one of both respect and urgency.

-"Miss Potter," he began, his voice resonating with the weight of his words, "I am Grimbold, the head of medicine at Gringotts. While you were asleep, we have conducted numerous tests to understand your condition. I am here to explain your medical and magical situation in detail, as much as you wish to know. However, there is something more pressing we must address first. Brodkrat will continue with his inquiries, and I shall provide medical insight. I assure you; I shall halt our discussion should you require rest. Are you prepared to proceed with this conversation?" her gazed shifting back to Brodkrat gesturing for him to proceed.

Brodkrat stare was unrelenting and grew intense as he approached the bedside, his eyes piercing into Harriet's soul.

- "Miss Potter, your transformation is neither accident nor illusion. It demands explanation, you are still under the laws of Gringotts considered attempting thief. If we found out you have voluntarily tried to deceive Gringotts, you could be sentenced to death. Should you lie to me today you might face severe consequences."

Appreciating his straightforward approach. Harriet took a deep breath, her gaze never leaving Brodkrat, her chin lifted in silent challenge. "I'm not a liar," she said, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. "I'll tell you everything I know."

Brodkrat took a step back, his expression unyielding.

-"Very well, Miss Potter. To begin, we must ascertain the truth of your involvement in any dark ritual. Have you, knowingly or willingly, participated in any such ceremonies, spells, or ritual?" The goblin doctor, Grimbold, observed her closely, his eyes flickering between her and the charts he held.

-"I didn't even know magic was real until this morning," she replied, "I swear, I've been living with the Dursleys, my aunt and uncle, in a Muggle home. Everything I've encountered today has been more than a shock. it's been like stepping into a world I never knew existed. I've never even heard of Gringotts before, let alone had any dealings with it." Her eyes searched their faces, hoping for a glimmer of belief, her heart pounding in her chest.

-"Miss Potter," Brodkrat said, raising an eyebrow. "You've been asleep for over forty hours, and your memories may be disjointed. Could you clarify your statement, please?" His firmness remained, yet his tone had softened slightly, hinting at a desire to help her navigate through this tumultuous ordeal.

Taking a deep calming breath, Harriet pushed aside the discomfort of the unfamiliar surroundings and the fear of the unknown. She sat up straight, her eyes never leaving Brodkrat.

-"When I was young, I had...accidental magic, but I didn't know it was real. It was just something strange that happened sometimes. The Dursley called me freak for that. And then, on the night of my eleventh birthday, Hagrid came and told me that I was a wizard..." Her voice grew stronger with each word, as if speaking the truth was a talisman against the fear that threatened to engulf her. "He said my parents were killed by Voldemort, and I survived because of some kind of protection. That's all I know about dark magic, really. It's all been a blur since then." Her hand found the edge of the bed again, her knuckles whitening as she squeezed tightly.

Brodkrat nodded thoughtfully, his eyes never leaving Harriet's.

-"Miss Potter, we need to delve deeper into this. Can you recall any instances where you might have been aware of manipulation concerning your identity? Perhaps moments where you felt like something was not quite right with the 'Harriet Potter' persona that has been built around you?" He spoke with the precision of one who has seen many secrets unravelled, his gaze unwavering and probing.

Her eyes searched Brodkrat, looking for any signs of disbelief or mockery. Harriet's sarcasm, honed by years with the Dursleys, threatened to spill over.

-"A lot of things haven't been 'quite right' around me my whole life," she quipped, despite the seriousness of the situation. "But, if you mean about being a girl, that's a new one. Could you clarify your question, please?" Her voice remained steady, but the sarcasm was clear, a defence mechanism against the storm of confusion swirling inside her.

The goblins in the room exchanged glances, their expressions a blend of amusement and intrigue at Harriet's spunk. Despite the gravity of the situation, they couldnt help but appreciate the fire in her eyes, a trait that was quite goblin-like. Brodkrat's sneer grew wider, his teeth glinting in the torchlight.

-"Miss Harriet Potter, it's quite fascinating that you've managed to maintain such wit amidst your... Situation. But let us be clear, the question remains: Did you willingly participate in constructing this false identity?"

Her sarcastic facade slipped for a moment, and the tremor in her voice grew more pronounced.

-"I never took part in building any false identity," she said, a hint of anger colouring her words. I've been Harriet Potter for as long as I can remember. I had no say in it, and I certainly didn't ask for this. I just want to know why, and how, and what happens next." Her hand tightened around the bed's edge, knuckles white from the grip.

Brodkrat glance at Grimbold giving him a subtle nod before proceeding.
- "Miss Potter," Brodkrat said with a solemn nod. "We must clarify an even more pressing matter. Did you knowingly, willingly, or not, bring the taint of a dark ritual to bear upon the sovereign soil of Gringotts?"

The room grew so still, it seemed as if even the flickering torches held their flame, waiting for her response. Harriet felt the weight of their gazes upon her, and the very air grew thick with anticipation. Her heart hammered in her chest, and she swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat.

-"I swear," she said, her voice shaking but earnest, "I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened. I just wanted to get my stuff from the vault. I didn't bring any taint here. I just wanted to be free, to live a peaceful life. I had no idea about any of this." Her eyes searched theirs, desperately seeking belief or at least understanding.

The medical head, Grimbold, coughed gently to clear his throat and adopted an official tone, addressing the Chief Inquisitor.

-"Miss Potter seems genuinely unaware of certain details regarding her condition. Perhaps we should rephrase our inquiry to accommodate the complexities that have been uncovered." He looked at Harriet, his eyes filled with a mix of pity and determination.

- "Miss Potter, there are aspects of your health that you have been kept in the dark about, which may shed light on the situation. I'll discuss the details in private with you after the interview if it's alright for you?

Nodding to Grimbold, Harriet felt a wave of relief wash over her.

-"I understand," she whispered, her voice quavering slightly. "I had no idea about any of this. If I did bring something tainted, it wasn't on purpose. I dont know anything about taint, or dark ritual."

Brodkrat leaned in, his eyes never leaving Harriet's. "Miss Potter," his voice grew softer, yet no less intense, "for the final question of this primary inquiry, can you assure us that you harbour no intentions of harming the sanctity of Gringotts or its citizens, the goblin nation?"

The room was silent, save for the distant echo of the bank's hustle and bustle, and the crackling of the torches on the wall, as all waited for her response.
-"I assure you, Brodkrat," Harriet spoke with conviction, her voice clear and firm despite her trembling hands, "I came here only to stash my things. I never wanted to be involved in any form of conflict or to harm anyone in any way. My sole intent was to live a peaceful life, as far from the chaos as I could get. Whatever has happened, it was never my wish to bring harm to anyone or any place, especially not to the goblin nation." Her eyes searched his, hoping he could see the truth in her words, the earnestness in her heart.

Brodkrat nodded slowly, his gaze never leaving hers. "Miss Potter," his tone was now less inquisitive, "we will leave you with Grimbold, our esteemed medical head."

With a gesture to Graglast, who havent said a word, they began to file out of the chamber with the account manager, their footsteps echoing in the silence.

-"We shall reconvene when you are stronger, and we have more information. Rest now, and do not fear. The truth will come to light." The door swung shut behind them, leaving Harriet alone with the goblin doctor, the flickering torches casting shadows across the room.

Grimbold's expression grew grave as he approached the bedside, his eyes filled with a mix of concern and professionalism.
-"Miss Potter," he began, his voice carrying the weight of what was to come, "I must inform you of your medical condition. To begin with, you are slightly malnourished and have sign of physical abuse. Harriet was trying to hide the bruise she knows she have all over her body thanks to all the Harriet-hunting her cousin love so much and when the Dursleys was rough with her. Additionally, your magical immunizations are not up to date, and your spectacles are woefully inadequate for your needs. There is another matter, more personal, which we must address." He paused, allowing her to absorb the information, noticing the blush creeping up her cheeks. "Miss Potter, it appears that your previous life has also left you uninformed about certain...feminine matters. his voice gentle yet firm.

-" If you wish," Grimbold spoke in a soothing tone, we can arrange for our Gringotts medical branch to restore you to wizarding standard health, including addressing any immediate issues arising from your... recent transformation. However, this service will incur a fee. Additionally, should you feel more comfortable, we could organize for a mediwitch employees to speak with you in a few days regarding your newfound femininity. This individual would be well-versed in such matters and can offer guidance and support." He waited, his gaze kind and patient.

-"Thank you, Grimbold," Harriet whispered, feeling overwhelmed by the kindness in his voice. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. "I'd appreciate any help you can get me. Its just... I don't know what to do. This is all so new, and I'm scared." Her eyes searched his, seeking comfort in his gaze.

-"Miss Potter," Grimbold nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of her situation. "I assure you that we will do everything in our power to assist you. His gaze lingering on her to let Harriet absorb the medical information about the physical status for your magical health there is really concerning subject we might address. We dont know exactly how yet, but it most probable you have been subjected to multiple ritual at a very young age... firstly, for the ritual that kept you appearing as a boy, it's a complex and dangerous spell that has been draining your magical essence. It's a miracle that you've not only survived but that your metamorphomagus abilities haven't fully manifested and harmed you. Should you have started puberty the harm would have been irreparable, and you would have been trapped in that false identity and probably lost your ability in the process. I suggest you stay as much as possible in bed, it his charmed to keep your ability subdued until you have a grasp of your real body. After a few days, we will see how you progress to see how you can start a re-education process, to learn how to control it. Your metamorphomagus ability is indeed something extraordinary and will take some time to adjust to. The effects from the Falls of Thief will likely leave you feeling dizzy for a few days. It is imperative that you remain here, under my care, until we can ensure you are fully stable." He paused, his eyes softening. "And do not worry about your family; we have already sent an owl to inform them of your whereabouts and condition. They will be notified of your unique circumstances, and we will arrange for them to visit when you are ready." With a gentle pat on her hand awkwardly.

She listened to him intently trying to grasp the full extent of the explanation he gave her "I appreciate it, Grimbold," she replied, her voice still shaky. "But please, don't worry about any trouble from my relatives. The Dursleys won't bother us. They never cared much for me anyway." her words were tinged with a sadness.
Grimbold furrowed his eyebrows, his goblin instincts baffled by the concept of neglecting a child.

-"Nevertheless," he said with a firm nod, "we must address the concerns of Gringotts. thats the second point you need to be aware about your magical condition. It appears that you have been the subject of dark and ancient rituals, something that has left a... trace within you." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "This is what has caused the bank's alarms to be triggered. We need to understand the extent of these rituals and their effects on you, not only for your well-being but for the security of our establishment." He held up a hand to forestall any interruptions.

His eyes grew serious as he leaned closer. "Miss Potter, our initial examinations revealed an ancient protection rune etched upon your forehead. It's a powerful enchantment, one that has been long forsaken. We've consulted with our most learned scholars, but even they are uncertain for its full purpose." He paused. "But what we've discovered within the protection is... troubling. It seems a piece of soul has been manipulated, the result of a ritual so dark, it's forbidden even in our ancient texts. We're working to uncover more information about the circumstances of what happened. The depth of this enchantment is something we must understand before you leave our care." He spoke with a solemnity that sent chills down Harriet's spine.

Her eyes searched his, seeking the truth that lay behind his words. Her thoughts raced, trying to grasp the gravity of the situation, her mind a whirlwind of questions. Her hand absently reached up to touch the spot where she knew the rune was hidden.

-"What do you mean by that?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "What did you find exactly?" Her gaze locked on him. Please, tell me everything I need to know." Her voice grew stronger with each word, her resolve unyielding.

-"Miss Potter," Grimbold began, his gaze unflinching, "the piece of soul we discovered is a grave concern. It's a taint that, if willingly brought into Gringotts, could warrant the most severe consequences. However, we suspect that it's trapped within the protective rune, which may explain your survival thus far. We're working to understand it, to reverse it safely. But you must rest, regain your strength. Your magical health is vital to us, and we will inform you of our findings as soon as possible." His tone was gentle but urgent, his words carrying the weight of the precarious situation.

Nodding, Harriet tried to absorb the gravity of the situation, her mind racing as she pieced together the puzzle of her identity. -"Thank you, Grimbold," she whispered, her eyes never leaving his. "I just want to be... me, without all these secrets and lies. Can you tell me more about this rune and the ritual?" Her voice was a mix of determination and fear, but the desire for truth burned bright. "I need to understand, to make sure no one else gets hurt."

-"Miss Potter, it appears these rituals have been performed on you at a very early age," Grimbold spoke with a gentle authority, "but with our assistance, we are hopeful that the one binding your identity has been left behind. For now, rest is your best ally. I allow you to read to occupy your mind. But do not push yourself too hard. Your body and soul are healing. I shall return tomorrow with more information and to check on your progress. Until then, rest, young one." With a final pat on her hand, he turned and made his way to the chamber's exit, the heavy door closing with a solid thud.

Her thoughts swirling like a tempest, Harriet felt the weight of the revelations crash down upon her. Despite her bravado, she was exhausted.
