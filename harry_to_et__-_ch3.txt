With a gentle nod, Healer Grimbold gathered his things. -"Rest well and continue your studies," he said The door clicked shut behind him, leaving her in the quiet solitude of the infirmary chamber. The candles flickered, casting shifting shadows across the ancient tomes. The air was thick with the scent of incense, and the distant murmur of the bank's activities outside the chamber was a comforting reminder that she was not alone in this subterranean world. Harry took a deep breath and returned her focus to the rune-covered parchment, her mind racing with questions and the need to understand the mysteries of her identity.
The following morning, the door to Harry's chamber creaked open, revealing Healer Grimbold standing alongside a woman with a fiery mane of hair and piercing grey eyes. She had an air of confidence and warmth that seemed to fill the room. -"Miss Potter," Grimbold announced with a small smile, "This is Andromeda Tonks. She's been assigned as your personal helper during your stay with us." Andromeda offered a curt nod, her eyes scanning Harry with a mix of curiosity and concern. -"Andromeda will assist you in your daily activities and provide companionship," he continued, his tone gentle yet firm. "Her experience and discretion are invaluable to us here." Harry looked up, a mix of surprise and apprehension crossing her features.
Harry felt a knot in her stomach loosen slightly at his reassurance. -"So, everything I say, everything we talk about, it's... private?" she asked, her voice tentative. -"Absolutely," Grimbold affirmed. "Your contract with her is ironclad, Miss Potter. Not even the most persuasive wizard or witch can coerce her into breaking secrecy." He paused, his gaze meeting hers. "Even if it's not directly related to your health, what you share with her stays within these walls. The only exceptions are matters of immediate danger or harm to you or gringots." He gave her a solemn nod. "You can trust us implicitly." *With those words, Harry felt a weight lifted from her shoulders. The protection of the ancient rune and the assurance of confidentiality allowed her to breathe a sigh of relief.
As Grimbold prepared to leave, he reminded her, "I shall return this evening to review your progress and discuss any further developments, Miss Potter. In the meantime, I encourage you to rest and recover. Remember, you have an appointment with Graglast, your steward, in the afternoon. He will be able to provide more information regarding your personal affairs and any assistance you may require during your stay." With a final nod, he swept out of the room, leaving Harry and Andromeda in the quiet embrace of the flickering candlelight.
She looked at Harry, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. -"So, you're my new boss?" she quipped, trying to lighten the atmosphere. "I must admit, I was a tad surprised when St Mungo's said I had to take an indefinite leave, and for what? To come down here and babysit a young witch." Her laugh was warm and genuine. -"But now I see why the secrecy and why they picked me for the job." She stepped closer, her gaze searching Harry's eyes. -"I'm here to help in any way you need, not just with the physical but the... well, the messier bits of life too." She paused, her expression growing more serious. "Whatever you're dealing with, we can talk about it, Harry. I've seen enough of the world's ugliness to know when someone's carrying more than their fair share." She reached out a hand, offering a gentle touch of camaraderie.
Harry nodded, feeling a flicker of relief at the goblin's endorsement. She had become accustomed to adults dismissing her, but there was something different about Andromeda. Her eyes searched the woman's face, looking for any sign of deceit or condescension. Finding none, she spoke in a subdued voice. "What did they tell you?" 
-"Only that a young witch needed assistance, and I was the one for that," Andromeda replied, "I didn't know why, but I guess they needed someone of your family, and I'm your closest kin who is a healer. I'm here to help you through this, Harry." She offered a small, understanding smile. -"Whether it's the spells that make you feel unwell or the weight of secrets that you might be carrying, I'm here to listen and offer support." Her gaze was sincere and empathetic, the lines around her eyes crinkling with kindness.
"What... what do you mean, 'my cousin'?" Her voice cracked as she sat up, the sudden movement sending a sharp pain through her side. -"How could I not know?" Her thoughts spun with confusion and a sudden, burning anger. "I've been kept in the dark about everything!" Her eyes searched Andromeda's, looking for answers in the warm, grey depths, her hair taking a slight red reflect. "What else don't I know?!"
-"Whoa, Harry, take a deep breath," Andromeda soothed, raising her hand in a peaceful gesture. "You're safe here. Your grandmother, Dorea, was my grandaunt. That makes us cousins, yes." She waited for Harry to settle, her eyes reflecting the candlelight with a gentle warmth. -"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We've got plenty of time to talk through everything."
"Ah, yes, the goblin humor," Andromeda said with a knowing smile, her voice filled with the same gentle firmness she had used with Harry since their first meeting. -"It's quite the... acquired taste. But if it wasn't for that, why me, boss?" She winked, using Harry's formal title to remind her of their relationship in a teasing manner.
Her eyes searched the room, seeking an anchor amidst the storm of revelations. "I guess I should start from the beginning, then," Harry murmured. -"It was Hagrid who told me I was a witch, and he brought me here to diagon alley. And since then, it's been a... a whirlwind." She took a moment, gathering her thoughts, and then continued "I've been living as a boy in the Muggle world, and it's only recently that I've discovered the truth..." She start to explain all the events of the previous days. -"They found out who I really am when I came back to Gringotts.. You're the only one they thought I could trust with all of this." Her words hung in the air, a poignant confession that seemed to echo the whispers of the ancient stones around them.Je comprends que vous souhaitez reformuler votre document.

Compassion swells within Andromeda as she listens to Harry's tale, a silent tear tracing down her cheek. She quickly wipes it away, not wanting to burden the young witch with her own emotions.
-"I understand now, Harry," she says, her voice filled with a mix of anger and sorrow. "To think of what you've been through..." Her gaze is steady as she speaks, her eyes reflecting the flicker of the candlelight. -"It's true, we are cousins. And I am indeed a healer, but that's not all. I have a daughter, a metamorphomagus, named Nymphadora. And a muggle-born husband, Ted, who's a wizard lawyer." The mention of her family brings a softness to her features, despite the gravity of their situation. -"But enough about me," she adds, her voice firm with resolve. "We need to focus on you and what you need right now." Andromeda stood by Harry's side, her hand resting gently on the younger witch's shoulder. "You're not alone in this."
Andromeda's smirk grew into a warm smile, sensing the tension in the room needed a reprieve. "But before we dive into all of that seriousness, let's talk about something a bit more... well, let's just say, 'essential' for your comfort." She leaned closer, her eyes gleaming with mischief. -"Girly needs," she whispered with a wink. "I've brought some supplies from the outside world, you know, the Muggle one." She pulled out a bag from her robes, revealing an assortment of items that would be considered quite peculiar in the hands of a witch from such a traditional family. -"These are for you," she said, placing the bag on the bedside table. "Things to make you feel a bit more like yourself, shall we?" Her voice was gentle, yet there was an undercurrent of strength in it,she start to explain everything to harry, telling him that she was not just a caretaker but a confidant, someone who had also walked the path of rebellion against the expectations of their shared family tree.
With a weary smile, Harry nodded during the crash course, her eyes lighting up slightly at the mention of 'girly needs'. It had been a whirlwind of informations, learning more about herself than she ever could have imagined. -"Thank you, Andromeda," she murmured, her voice cracking with emotion. "I don't know what I'd do without someone like you. But... I think I need a break. This is all so much to take in." Her gaze met Andromeda's, searching for understanding. "Could we... maybe just sit and talk for a bit?" Her shoulders slumped with the weight of the revelations, and she leaned back against the pillows with a sigh. "I'm still trying to get used to all of this."
"Of course, Harry," Andromeda said, her expression softening. -"To be honest, Nymphadora would have bolted at the mention of 'girly talk'. She's always been a bit of a tomboy," she chuckled, the sound a gentle melody in the otherwise solemn atmosphere of the infirmary. -"But I'm glad you're taking it all in stride. Just remember, it's important to be true to yourself, no matter what anyone else expects of you." Her gaze grew more serious. "You're not just a girl, or just a boy, or just a witch. You're a person. A strong, brave, and fascinating individual. Whichever way you choose to express that, it will be just fine." She offered Harry the bag once more, her hand lingering for a moment before withdrawing it, giving the young witch the space she needed. -"Take your time, Harry. These things are yours now, to use as you wish." With a nod of understanding, she pulled up a chair beside the bed.

She spoke of the cruelty and the isolation, her eyes flickering with remembered pain. Andromeda listened with a professional understanding, nodding occasionally, her eyes never leaving Harry's. After they had shared their meal in companionable silence, Harry felt a little stronger, ready to face the next part of her journey. but the bond between them had grown stronger. With a newfound resolve, she turned to Andromeda. "Let's go see Graglast." -"Yes, Harry," Andromeda said, standing up and smoothing her robes. "Your steward is expecting us. Let's not keep him waiting."
With Andromeda's gentle encouragement, she approached the heavy oak door that led to the office of Graglast, the steward. Her hand hovered over the knob before she mustered the courage to knock. The muffled bark from within echoed through the thick wood, a clear invitation to enter. Her heart pounding, Harry pushed the door open to reveal a cluttered room, the air thick with the scent of dusty parchments and ancient incense. Graglast, a stoic goblin with piercing black eyes, looked up from his ledger, his expression an angry annoyed glare. "Ah, Miss Potter, do you know how much work you gave me the last days?" he rumbled,
Harry stepped into the room, her eyes widening at the mountain of parchments and scrolls that threatened to topple over the steward's desk. Graglast, his furrowed brows knit tightly together, didn't even spare Andromeda a glance as he addressed her with a stern tone. "Miss Potter," his voice was a low rumble, as if the very walls of the chamber could feel his displeasure. "Those forms you have neglected are of the highest importance. They are long overdue for an update, and the very fate of your inheritance may depend on it. It is your duty to ensure they are completed posthaste." He slammed his hand down on the desk, his sharp claws digging into the wood, emphasizing his words. Andromeda watched the exchange with a wary expression, having dealt with the goblin's sharp tongue before.
Andromeda stepped in, her voice firm yet measured. "We thank you for your hard work, Graglast," she said, giving Harry a reassuring smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. -"Miss Potter will take care of it immediately," she assured him,* taking the stack of parchment from the goblin's outstretched hand.* Her gaze lingered on the steward for a moment longer. With a curt nod, she turned back to Harry, her eyes speaking volumes of something's off. -"Come along, Harry," she said softly, "Let's find a quiet place where we can tackle this together." She led the way out of the office, her footsteps echoing down the cold stone corridor 
Harry felt a flash of irritation at being talked down to, but she kept her cool. -"What was that about?" she whispered to Andromeda once they were out of earshot, her eyes flashing with a hint of annoyance.
"I'm sorry if that seemed overbearing, Harry," Andromeda began, her voice low and soothing. "But you need to know how to handle these situations, especially in a place like Gringotts." -"From my experience, when someone in authority speaks to you like that, it's usually for one of three reasons: they're testing you, they're genuinely upset, or they're hiding something." She paused,* her gaze intense.* -"As your healer and confidant, it's my duty to guide you through this. Remember, Harry, no matter what, never let anyone‚Äîbe it wizard or goblin‚Äîmake you feel less than you are. You are the heir to a powerful legacy, and you do not bend to their will. If something feels amiss, trust your instincts. Grab your things and leave. Do you understand?" Her eyes searched Harry's, looking for signs of comprehension. -"Your well-being is of the utmost importance to me, and I don't want you to face such interactions alone." She handed the parchments back to Harry with a gentle pat on her hand.
Looking at Andromeda with a mix of defiance and understanding, Harry nodded firmly. "If he was just testing me, then he's not much of a steward," she murmured, "but if he's really upset or trying to deceive me..." Her voice trailed off, but the fire in her eyes spoke volumes. -"Either way, I'm not going to stand for it. I'll find out the truth and make him regret it if he's crossed a line." Her fists clenched on the paperwork. "But first, we need to talk to someone who actually knows what's going on around here. Someone who won't play games with me." Her gaze hardened as she turned towards the corridor leading to Brodkrat's office. "Let's go. I've had enough of this secrecy and disrespect." -"I know exactly who we need to speak to," she added with a grim determination, her stride purposeful as she headed towards the office where the truth might lie.
Andromeda followed closely behind Harry, her eyes scanning the parchments as they walked. "The Chief Inquisitor's office..." she murmured, her heart skipping a beat when she saw the gold lettering on the heavy wooden door. -"I don't know if this is the best course of action," she whispered,
"Don't worry," Harriet said with a smirk, knocking gently on the heavy door of Brodkrat's office. "He'll only behead you if I ask nicely," she quipped, proud of her joke when she see a sudden paleness on Andromeda's face
"Brodkrak, my dear," she called out as they entered, noticing the goblin's stern gaze soften slightly. "How's the head-count today?" she quipped, trying to lighten the mood. Her eyes darted to Andromeda, who looked paler than usual. She had heard the whispered words‚Äî'you're really his goddaughter'‚Äîand she knew that this revelation would add another piece of information they need to discuss
Brodkrat's sneer remained steadfast as he regarded Harry and Andromeda, his gaze lingering on the parchments in Harry's hands. -"Ah, Miss Potter," he said, his voice a blend of curiosity and challenge. "It seems you've brought company. And not just any company," his eyes narrowed at Andromeda. "But a member of the esteemed Black family. How... interesting." He tapped a clawed finger against his chin -"Someone more to put on the list, perhaps?" he suggested, Brokdrat's expression was a playful taunt, the tension in the room thickening like a potion about to boil over. -"But let's not dilly-dally with jokes," he said, his eyes flicking back to Harry. -"Take a seat, and let's talk about why you're really here."
"Indeed, Brodkrat," she said, her tone shifting to something more serious as she handed him the paperwork. "Graglast seems to think these are more important than explaining their purpose to me." Her eyes met Brodkrat's, a silent challenge in their depths. -"I would like an unbiased point of view," she continued, her voice steady. "Do I simply need to replace my steward, or is there something more at play here that requires your... discretion?" Her hand hovered over the paperwork, a hint of uncertainty lacing her words.
Brodkrat's gaze shifted from Harry to the parchments, then back to her, his expression unreadable. After a moment of silent contemplation, he lifted an eyebrow. The goblin took the paperwork, his eyes scanning over the documents with a swiftness that suggested he had done this a hundred times before. "Miss Potter," he said, his tone now one of amusement, "if all my detectives were as efficient as you, goblins truly would rule the world."
Brodkrat and Harry shared a brief laugh, but Andromeda's gaze remained fixed on the seriousness of the situation. She watched as Brodkrat's eyes scanned the documents with a speed that made it clear he was no stranger to such matters. -"We talked just yesterday about our little inquiry," Brodkrat said, his smile not quite reaching his eyes. "And already you bring me leads and evidence today." His words hung in the air like a question, his gaze shifting from Harry to Andromeda, who felt a sudden chill run down her spine.
"To be honest, Brodkrat," Harriet said with a nod to Andromeda, a glint of appreciation in her eye, "The credit truly goes to Andromeda's swift thinking. She suggested we get back to the infirmary to read through and sign the forms. It seems we have quite the paperwork to tackle," she added with a sigh, her eyes never leaving the goblin's as she spoke.
Brodkrat's expression grew more solemn as he carefully placed the parchments on his desk. "Miss Potter," his tone shifted to one of authority, "as the Chief Inquisitor of Wizard-Goblin Relations, I would like to formally request that you allow me to handle any disputes or concerns you have regarding your inheritance. It is within my purview to ensure that all parties act with the utmost transparency and respect for the law." -"I assure you that I will not rest until any issues are resolved to your satisfaction. Will you entrust this to me?" His gaze was steady, his tone official, leaving no room for doubt.
Sitting straight, Harry met Brodkrat's gaze with a firm nod. "Chief Inquisitor, you have all my trust and validation in pursuing any dispute or concerns regarding Gringotts or my inheritance," she said, her voice a blend of confidence and respect.

Feeling a sense of closure, Harry and Andromeda stood from their seats with a quiet grace, the gravity of their meeting palpable. "Thank you, Brodkrat," Harry said, his eyes never leaving the goblin's. "Your help is greatly appreciated. We'll be in the infirmary if you need us."

The rest of the afternoon was spent with Harry eagerly absorbing Andromeda's insights into the intricate world of wand magic, despite the restriction of not being able to practice within the confines of Gringotts. Her words painted vivid images of spells and incantations, filling Harry's mind with a longing for the freedom to truly explore her newfound heritage.
