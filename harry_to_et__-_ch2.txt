Harry's eyes widened in shock, and her hand, still holding the knife, began to shake violently. A high-pitched scream built in her throat, echoing through the chamber like a banshee's wail. As the revelation of being a girl hit her, the weight of her new reality became too much to bear. He collapsed to the floor, the knife clattering against the cold stone.and the world grew dark around her.


Harry's eyes slowly adjusted to the dim light, taking in the unfamiliar, yet comforting, surroundings. The ceiling, a masterpiece of ancient stonework, arched high above her, reminiscent of a drawing ot the Moria she had once seen in a favourite book. Her heart raced, trying to piece together the puzzle of her recent experiences - the wrong train, her way back to gringots, the icy water of the falls of thief, and the revelation of her true identity. It was all too much to process at once. She swallowed hard, feeling the dryness in her throat, and whispered to herself, "What does this mean?"


The firm yet gentle voice of a goblin nurse pierced the silence beside Harry, urging her to remain on the bed. 
-"The doctor and appropriate staff will be with you shortly to discuss your condition, Miss Potter," she assured, her tone a blend of professionalism and concern. Harry's mind raced, trying to grasp the implications of being called "Miss Potter". The nurse's words brought a sudden realization of her vulnerability in this unfamiliar place. 
She nodded, complying with the instructions, feeling a mix of fear and nervousness for the explanations that were to come. The flickering torch danced on the walls, casting eerie shadows on the bare stone wall of the room.


"Thanks," Harry murmured, still reeling from the revelation. She clutched the edge of the bed, the fabric rough against her skin, reminding her of the Dursleys' old blankets. 
How could she be a girl? She looked down at her trembling hands, the knuckles white from gripping the bed so tightly. Her thoughts swirled in a maelstrom of doubt and confusion, but she knew one thing for certain: she had to find out the truth.


The door to the chamber creaked open, and three goblins entered, their footsteps echoing in the hollow space. The first, which harry recognise  from her meeting with him, a goblin with a stern countenance and sharp eyes, introduced himself officially as Brodkrat, the Wizarding Inquisitor, his voice resonating with authority. Behind him, a goblin in a pristine medical robe, the head of medicine at Gringotts, nodded in acknowledgment. The third, adorned in a finely tailored suit, identified himself as the steward of the Potter family finances. The goblins exchanged a knowing glance before turning to Harry, their expressions a blend of curiosity and solemnity.
"Miss Potter,  Brodkrat said ,  This is our esteemed medical head, and the goblin beside him is responsible for managing the Potter vaults. We are here to offer our assistance in understanding your... unique circumstances."


Looking up at Brodkrat and the other goblins, Harry's eyes searched their faces, seeking any signs of mockery or deceit, but found only concern and curiosity. She took a deep breath, the cold air filling her lungs and steeling her resolve.
-"I would really appreciate the truth about all of this," she said, her voice steady despite the quaking inside. She gestured to her body, a question hanging in the air.
-"How can I be a girl? I've been a boy my whole life..."


The goblin doctor cleared his throat, his expression one of both respect and urgency.
"Miss Potter," he began, his voice resonating with the weight of his words, "I am grimbold, the head of medicine at Gringotts. While you were asleep, we've conducted numerous tests to understand your condition. I'm here to explain your medical and magical situation in detail, as much as you wish to know. However, there's something more pressing we must address first. Brodkrat will continue with his inquiries, and I shall provide medical insight. I assure you, I shall halt our discussion should you require rest. Are you prepared to proceed with this conversation?"


Nodding, Harry felt a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. "Thank you, grimbold," she murmured, appreciating his straightforward approach. She took a deep breath, bracing herself for what was to come.
"I'm ready," she said firmly, her voice quivering slightly. "I need to understand what's happening to me."


Brodkrat's gaze grew intense as he approached the bedside, his eyes piercing into Harry's soul. 
-"Miss Potter," his tone was a warning whisper, as if the very walls of the chamber could hear the gravity of his words, 
-"I understand that this revelation has been unsettling. However, your honesty is paramount in this inquiry. You are no longer a mere thief, but a witness to something... Unpleasant. If I find that you have been deceitful, I will not hesitate to press charges. Do you understand the seriousness of your position?"
The steward nodded gravely, his eyes never leaving Harry's. The room felt heavier, as if the very air was thick with the implications of his words.


Her gaze never leaving Brodkrat's, Harry's chin lifted in silent challenge. "I'm not a liar," she said, her voice steady despite the turmoil within. "But I promise, I'll tell you everything I know. Just please, help me understand."


Brodkrat took a step back, his expression unyielding. "Very well, Miss Potter. To begin, we must ascertain the truth of your involvement in any dark ritual. Have you, knowingly or willingly, participated in any such ceremonies, spells, or ritual?" The goblin doctor, Grimbold, observed her closely, his eyes flickering between her and the charts he held,


"I didn't even know magic was real until this morning," *she replied, * "I swear, I've been living with the Dursleys, my aunt and uncle, in a Muggle home. Everything I've encountered today has been more than a shock - it's been like stepping into a world I never knew existed. I've never even heard of Gringotts before, let alone had any dealings with it." Her eyes searched their faces, hoping for a glimmer of belief, her heart pounding in her chest.


"Miss Potter," Brodkrat said, raising an eyebrow. "You've been asleep for over twenty hours, and your memories may be disjointed. Could you clarify your statement, please?" His firmness remained, yet his tone had softened slightly, hinting at a desire to help her navigate through this tumultuous ordeal.


Taking a deep calming breath, Harry pushed aside the discomfort of the unfamiliar surroundings and the fear of the unknown. She sat up straight, her eyes never leaving Brodkrat's. "When I was young, I had...accidental magic, but I didn't know it was real. It was just something strange that happened sometimes. And then, on the night of my eleventh birthday, Hagrid came and told me that I was a wiza..witch." Her voice grew stronger with each word, as if speaking the truth was a talisman against the fear that threatened to engulf her. "He said my parents were killed by Voldemort, and I survived because of some kind of protection. That's all I know about dark magic, really. It's all been a blur since then." Her hand found the edge of the bed again, her knuckles whitening as she squeezed tightly.


Brodkrat nodded thoughtfully, his eyes never leaving Harry's. "Miss Potter, we need to delve deeper into this. Can you recall any instances where you might have been aware of manipulation concerning your identity? Perhaps moments where you felt like something wasn't quite right with the 'Harry Potter' persona that has been built around you?" He spoke with the precision of one who has seen many secrets unraveled, his gaze unwavering and probing.


Her eyes searched Brodkrat's, looking for any signs of disbelief or mockery. Harry's sarcasm, honed by years with the Dursleys, threatened to spill over. 
-"A lot of things haven't been 'quite right' around me my whole life," she quipped, despite the seriousness of the situation. 
-"But, if you mean about being a girl, that's a new one. Could you clarify your question, please?" Her voice remained steady, but the sarcasm was clear, a defense mechanism against the storm of confusion swirling inside her.


The goblins in the room exchanged glances, their expressions a blend of amusement and intrigue at Harry's spunk. Despite the gravity of the situation, they couldn't help but appreciate the fire in her eyes, a trait that was quite goblin-like. Brodkrat's sneer grew wider, his teeth glinting in the torchlight. 
-"Miss Potter, or should I say, Miss Harriet Potter, it's quite fascinating that you've managed to maintain such wit amidst your... Situation. But let us be clear, the question remains: Did you willingly participate in constructing this false identity?"


Her sarcastic facade slipped for a moment, and the tremor in her voice grew more pronounced. 
-"I never took part in building any false identity," she said, a hint of anger coloring her words. 
-"I've been Harry Potter for as long as I can remember. I had no say in it, and I certainly didn't ask for this. I just want to know why, and how, and what happens next." Her hand tightened around the bed's edge, knuckles white from the grip.


"Miss Potter," Brodkrat said with a solemn nod. "We must clarify an even more pressing matter. Did you knowingly, willingly, or not, bring the taint of a dark ritual to bear upon the sovereign soil of Gringotts?" The room grew so still, it seemed as if even the flickering torches held their flame, waiting for her response. Harry felt the weight of their gazes upon her, and the very air grew thick with anticipation.
[[harry_potter]]: Her heart hammered in her chest, and she swallowed the lump that had formed in her throat. 
-"I swear," she said, her voice shaking but earnest, "I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened. I just wanted to get my stuff from the vault. I didn't bring any taint here. I just wanted to be free, to live a peaceful life. I had no idea about any of this." Her eyes searched theirs, desperately seeking belief or at least understanding.


The medical head, Grimbold, coughed gently to clear his throat and adopted an official tone, addressing the Chief Inquisitor. "Miss Potter seems genuinely unaware of certain details regarding her condition. Perhaps we should rephrase our inquiry to accommodate the complexities that have been uncovered." He looked at Harry, his eyes filled with a mix of pity and determination. "Miss Potter, there are aspects of your health that you have been kept in the dark about, which may shed light on the situation. I'll discuss the details in private with you after the interview if it's alright for you?


Nodding to Grimbold, Harry felt a wave of relief wash over her. 
-"I understand," she whispered, her voice quavering slightly. "I had no idea about any of this. If I did bring something tainted, it wasn't on purpose. I just want to find out the truth and make things right." 


Brodkrat leaned in, his eyes never leaving Harry's. "Miss Potter," his voice grew softer, yet no less intense, "for the final question of this primary inquiry, can you assure us that you harbor no intentions of harming the sanctity of Gringotts or its citizens, the goblin nation?" The room was silent, save for the distant echo of the bank's hustle and bustle, and the crackling of the torches on the wall, as all waited for her response.


"I assure you, Brodkrat," Harry spoke with conviction, her voice clear and firm despite her trembling hands, "I came here only to retrieve my things. I never wanted to be involved in any form of conflict or to arm anyone in any way. My sole intent was to live a peaceful life, as far from the chaos as I could get. Whatever has happened, it was never my wish to bring harm to anyone or any place, especially not to the goblin nation." Her eyes searched his, hoping he could see the truth in her words, the earnestness in her heart.


Brodkrat nodded slowly, his gaze never leaving hers. "Miss Potter," his tone was now more sympathetic, "we will leave you with Grimbold, our esteemed medical head. Your safety is guaranteed while you are on Gringotts soil." With a curt gesture to the other goblins, they began to file out of the chamber, their footsteps echoing in the silence. "We shall reconvene when you are stronger and we have more information. Rest now, and do not fear. The truth will come to light." The door swung shut behind them, leaving Harry alone with the goblin doctor, the flickering torches casting shadows across the room.


Grimbold's expression grew grave as he approached the bedside, his eyes filled with a mix of concern and professionalism. "Miss Potter," he began, his voice carrying the weight of what was to come, "I must inform you of your medical condition. To begin with, you are slightly malnourished, and have sign of physical abuse that I know you are aware of. Additionally, your magical immunizations are not up to date, and your spectacles are woefully inadequate for your needs. But there is another matter, more personal, which we must address." He paused, allowing her to absorb the information, noticing the blush creeping up her cheeks. "Miss Potter, it appears that your previous life has also left you uninformed about certain...feminine matters.*, his voice gentle yet firm.


"Miss Potter," Grimbold spoke in a soothing tone, "If you wish, we can arrange for our Gringotts medical branch to restore you to wizarding standard health, including addressing any immediate issues arising from your... recent transformation. However, this service will incur a fee. Additionally, should you feel more comfortable, we could organize for one of our witch employees to speak with you in a few days regarding your newfound femininity. This individual is well-versed in such matters and can offer guidance and support." *He waited, his gaze kind and patient


"Thank you, Grimbold," Harry whispered, feeling overwhelmed by the kindness in his voice. She took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing thoughts. "I'd appreciate any help you can give me. I just... I don't know what to do. This is all so new, and I'm scared." Her eyes searched his, seeking comfort in his gaze. 


"Miss Potter," Grimbold nodded solemnly, understanding the gravity of her situation. "I assure you that we will do everything in our power to assist you. Your metamorphomagus ability is indeed something extraordinary and will take some time to adjust to. The effects from the Falls of Thief will likely leave you feeling dizzy for a few days. It is imperative that you remain here, under my care, until we can ensure you are fully stable." He paused, his eyes softening. "And do not worry about your family; we have already sent an owl to inform them of your whereabouts and condition. They will be notified of your unique circumstances, and we will arrange for them to visit when you are ready." With a gentle pat on her hand, he offered a small, reassuring smile.


"I appreciate it, Grimbold," she replied, her voice still shaky. "But please, don't worry about any trouble from my relatives. The Dursleys won't bother us. They never cared much for me anyway." *Her words were tinged with a sadness *


Grimbold furrowed his eyebrows, his goblin instincts baffled by the concept of neglecting a child, especially one as extraordinary as Harry. "Nevertheless," he said with a firm nod, "we must address the concerns of Gringotts. It appears that you have been the subject of dark and ancient rituals, something that has left a...trace within you." He paused, choosing his words carefully. "This is what has caused the bank's alarms to be triggered. We need to understand the extent of these rituals and their effects on you, not only for your well-being but for the security of our establishment." He held up a hand to forestall any interruptions.


Her eyes widened with curiosity, despite the fear that clutched her heart. "What do you mean by that?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "What did you find exactly?" Her gaze locked on him


Grimbold's eyes grew serious as he leaned closer. "Miss Potter, our initial examinations revealed an ancient protection rune etched upon your forehead. It's a powerful enchantment, one that's been long forgotten. We've consulted with our most learned scholars, but even they are at a loss for its full purpose." He paused. "But what we've discovered within the protection is... troubling. It seems a piece of soul has been manipulated, the result of a ritual so dark, it's forbidden even in our ancient texts. We're working tirelessly to uncover more information about the circumstances of what happened. The depth of this enchantment is something we must understand before you leave our care." He spoke with a solemnity that sent chills down Harry's spine.


Her eyes searched his, seeking the truth that lay behind his words.Her thoughts raced, trying to grasp the gravity of the situation, her mind a whirlwind of questions.Her hand absently reached up to touch the spot where she knew the rune was hidden. "Please, tell me everything I need to know." Her voice grew stronger with each word, her resolve unyielding.


"Miss Potter," Grimbold began, his gaze unflinching, "the piece of soul we discovered is a grave concern. It's a taint that, if willingly brought into Gringotts, could warrant the most severe consequences. However, we suspect that it's trapped within the protective rune, which may explain your survival thus far. As for the ritual that kept you appearing as a boy, it's a complex and dangerous spell that has been draining your magical essence. It's a miracle that you've not only survived but that your metamorphomagus abilities haven't fully manifested and harmed you. We're working to understand it, to reverse it safely. But you must rest, regain your strength. Your magical health is vital to us, and we will inform you of our findings as soon as possible." His tone was gentle but urgent, his words carrying the weight of the precarious situation.


Nodding, Harry tried to absorb the gravity of the situation, her mind racing as she pieced together the puzzle of her identity. "Thank you, Grimbold," she whispered, her eyes never leaving his. "I just want to be... me, without all these secrets and lies. Can you tell me more about this soul piece and the ritual?" Her voice was a mix of determination and fear, but the desire for truth burned bright. "I need to understand, to make sure no one else gets hurt."


"Miss Potter, it appears these rituals have been performed on you at a very early age," Grimbold spoke with a gentle authority, "but with our assistance, we are hopeful that the one concerning your identity has been left behind. For now, rest is your best ally. I allow you to take light walks within the designated areas, under supervision, and engage in reading to occupy your mind. But do not push yourself too hard. Your body and soul are healing. I shall return tomorrow with more information and to check on your progress. Until then, rest, young one. " With a final pat on her hand, he turned and made his way to the chamber's exit, the heavy door closing with a solid thud, leaving Harry to her thoughts and the flickering embrace of the torchlit shadows.

Her thoughts swirling like a tempest, Harry felt the weight of the revelations crash down upon her. Despite her bravado, she was exhausted. Her eyelids grew heavy, and she lay back on the bed, her mind racing with questions she had no answers to. The flickering torches danced on the stone walls, creating an eerie ballet of light and shadow that seemed to mirror the chaos within her. The room grew dimmer, and her eyelids grew heavier, her body demanding the reprieve of sleep. With a sigh, she gave in, allowing the soft embrace of darkness to swallow her up, hoping that in the morning, the world would make a bit more sense.
