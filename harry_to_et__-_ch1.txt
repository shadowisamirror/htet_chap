Shit," Harry murmured under his breath as he stared at the train chart, his eyes tracing back over the name of the station he had just read. "I can't believe I got on the wrong bloody train," he muttered, his voice a mix of disbelief and frustration. 
Feeling the cold metal of the train car press against his back. The peoples around him seemed oblivious to his turmoil, lost in their own worlds of newspapers and coffee cups, like always 
in his life he can't rely on others to help him.
-"Looks like I'll be getting off at the next stop and heading back to Diagon Alley," Harry thought to himself, his eyes flicking to the clock overhead, thinking his relatives will be mad if he come back after dinner time...

The pouch of galleons in my pocket feels like a brick he mused, his thumb tracing over the coarse fabric as he pondered his options.
-"They're already livid, might as well make it worth their while," Harry murmured, his eyes glancing over the muggle street signs as the train rumbled through the cityscape.
-"Maybe I can find an hotel, lay low for a bit," he decided, his stomach rumbling slightly as he thought about food, but the need for a safe place to think was more urgent.
-"I need to dodge the Dursleys' wrath," he whispered, his heart racing at the thought of facing their anger once again.

"Alright," Harry said, his voice a mix of resignation and determination. "I know I can't pay for a room with this," he jingled the pouch of wizard gold, "not in this world anyway." He stepped off the train, the sound of the doors closing behind him echoing through the platform like the finality of a tomb.
-"I guess I'll have to find a place in Diagon Alley," Harry thought, his eyes scanning the grimy platform with a hint of trepidation. The thrill of freedom and avoiding the dursley making him giddy as he walk outside in the London streets in the evening. He could never rely on adults anyway, so he know he can take care of himself
His eyes locking onto the distant speck of light that signaled the Leaky Cauldron's location.
He took a deep breath, his eyes narrowing in resolve, and headed towards the hidden pub, the gateway to the wizarding world where he hope to find an escape from the abusive environment of the dursley.

-"Everyone stares at my scar," Harry thought, his hand instinctively reaching to cover the lightning bolt-shaped mark on his forehead. He shivered at the memory of their wide eyes and whispered conversations. It's always the same.
He tugged at the hood of Dudley's old, oversized sweatshirt, trying to conceal the scar as best he could. The material was itchy, but the anonymity it provided was worth the discomfort. Trying to move his untameable hair in front of his scare to have another layer of security, he put all in might to conceal his scar
-"Can't have that," he mumbled to himself, his voice barely audible. "Not when I'm trying to keep a low profile."
With a firm step, Harry approached the door of the Leaky Cauldron, the warm, inviting light spilling onto the cobblestone street. He paused, his heart pounding in his chest.
-"Here goes nothing," he murmured, pushing the door open and slipping into the dimly lit pub.*

"I've got to be quick," Harry muttered under his breath, his eyes darting around the room. He spotted the back door leading to the alley and moved swiftly towards it.
The smells of roasting meats and spilled butterbeer hung in the air, a stark contrast to the stale, oppressive scent of the muggle train.
-"I can't risk anyone recognizing me," he thought, his hand tightening around the handle of his hogwarts  chest as he wove through the crowd of witches and wizards.

-"Alright," Harry whispered to himself, taking a deep breath. "First things first."
He took out his wand from the pocket, focus as he pointed it at the brick wall.
-"Remember what Hagrid did," he murmured, recalling the gentle giant's action. "Just tap it like this."
He tapped the wall three times with the tip of his wand, the cool stone vibrating slightly under his touch. The wall shivered and then slid aside to reveal the  entrance of diagon alley.
Harry breathed, his eyes widening at the sight of the magical shops and people bustling about. He stepped through the archway, feeling a sense of relief wash over him as he left the muggle world behind.

-"But I've got to keep my head down," he reminded himself, his hand reflexively reaching for the hood of his sweatshirt. The last thing he needed was to be recognized.
-"Gringotts should be a good start I can left my stuff in my safe " Harry thought his heart racing with excitement and anxiety. He weaved through the cobbled street
He took a moment to compose himself, then approached the grand entrance of Gringotts, his steps echoing through the alley like.

He waited patiently in line, his eyes darting around, searching for a teller who looked less busy and more likely to be understanding of his situation.
-"I can't believe I'm here," he thought, his heart fluttering in his chest. The scent of goblin metal and aged parchment filled his nose
As he approached the counter, he felt the weight on his heart, goblins are scary.
-"I need to get to my vault but I don't have my key" Harry said, trying to keep his voice calm and even. "Could you help me?"
The teller left an eyebrow, his gaze lingering briefly on Harry's concealed apparence

the goblin said, his tone sharp and disbelieving. "You're telling me, wizard-whoever-you-are," the creature's voice dripped with skepticism, "that you've lost the very key that is entrusted to your care?"
The goblin's eyes narrowed, scrutinizing Harry like he was a suspicious character in a tale of wizarding crime.
-"Know this," the goblin continued, his voice like the clink of gold coins, "Gringotts does not take lightly to the loss of its property. If indeed you've misplaced your key, it'll cost you dearly: 10 galleons for the fine, 5 for the replacement, and a rather... unpleasant verification process to prove your identity."
The goblin's gaze hardened, his clawed hands resting on the countertop. "And should we discover you're trying to pull a fast one," he warned, his voice low and ominous, "you won't be leaving this bank so easily. Are you quite certain you've lost your key?"

the teller stated firmly, his sharp gaze never leaving Harry. "Until the verification process is complete, your wand is confiscated under Gringotts law. Any attempt to retrieve it will be met with severe consequences. Go to this room." The teller gestured to the side, where a hidden door opened to reveal a small, dimly lit chamber.

harry swallowed hard, his heart racing. He had been through worse, but the directness and strictness of the goblins were unnerving.
-"I understand," Harry said, his voice barely above a whisper. . He knew he had to Abid by the system here, even if it meant facing a bit of fear.
With a nod to the goblin, he stepped into the chamber, his eyes adjusting to the low light. He felt the weight of the situation pressing down on him, but also a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, he could find some information about himself and his heritage in the goblin wall.

In the dimly lit chamber, the stone walls seemed to close in around Harry as he faced the goblin behind the desk. The creature's eyes gleamed with curiosity, his sharp teeth bared in a sneer.
-"What do we have here, a lost little lamb, or perhaps a wolf in sheep's clothing?" the goblin taunted.
The air grew thick with tension, and Harry's palms grew slick with sweat as he realized the gravity of his situation. He was in the heart of the wizarding bank, surrounded by the very creatures who had safeguarded his inheritance since the tragic death of his parents. The goblin's scrutiny was unrelenting, as if he could see through Harry's very soul. The room was cold, the only sound the echo of Harry's shallow breaths and the tick of an ancient clock, reminding him that time was slipping away.

Harry took a deep breath, his eyes never leaving the goblin's. "I'm not a thief," he said, his voice firm despite the quiver of anxiety in his chest. "The teller told me I have to follow the procedure to prove my identity, and I didn't claim to be anyone." he added, his voice cracking slightly.
He felt the sting of tears in his eyes but blinked them away, not wanting to show any weakness in this intimidating place.
"I'm just looking for answers," Harry said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Please, I'm Harry Potter, and I've come to get my things from my vault. Can't you see I'm telling the truth?"
The goblin's expression didn't change, but Harry felt a flicker of something in the air, a shift in the energy of the room. Perhaps, just perhaps, he had gotten through to the creature. He hoped so. His future depended on it.

The goblin's gaze remained fixed on Harry, his eyes narrowed. It was true that his job was to discern the truth from the countless falsehoods that wizards often tried to sell. And yet, there was something in the boy's eyes that spoke of sincerity, a desperation that seemed to resonate with his own experiences with those who had suffered. With a sigh, he leaned back in his chair, his clawed hands steepled before him.
-"Very well," the goblin said, his voice softer than before. "We shall begin the verification process. You're  considered a temptative thief under gringots law, leave your belonging here, it's now gringots property until you're proving to be who you claim. But beware, boy-who-claim-to-be-Harry-Potter, if we find any trace of threat against gringots, you'll not like the result. The Falls of Thief shall be your first test." The goblin standing an leading harry to a side door, and open to reveal a darkened corridor, the  sound of rushing water echoing through it. "Follow me. But remember, any attempt to deceive us, and you shall face the consequences," he warned, his tone leaving no room for doubt.
The warrior goblin stepped aside, allowing Harry to pass. As they walked down the corridor, the sound of the water grew louder, and a cold, damp chill settled over him like a shroud. Harry took a deep breath his heart pounding in his chest. He had faced worse than this, he told himself.

"Excuse me, sir," Harry said, his curiosity pushing through his fear. "Could you tell me your name?"
The goblin paused, his eyes flickering with something that might have been amusement before he replied. "Brodkrat," the goblin said gruffly. "And I'd advise you to mind your manners, Harry Potter. This is no place for idle chit-chat."
With that, Brodkrat led Harry through the doorway and into a vast cavern with a waterfall.

Brodkrat stopped at the edge of the waterfall, the water shimmering with an eerie blue light as it cascaded down into the pool below. The rush of the water was deafening, the spray cool against Harry's face. "Walk through the waterfall and come back," Brodkrat instructed, his voice barely audible over the din. "The enchanted water will wash of any magic effect modifying your apparence. If you don't use any disguise you shall pass unharmed."
The waterfall loomed before Harry, a wall of liquid crystal, sparkling in the dim light of the cavern. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for what lay ahead.
-"Here goes," Harry thought, his heart racing as he took a tentative step forward, the roar of the water drowning out all other sounds. As he approached the base of the fall, the water grew colder, sending shivers down his spine. He closed his eyes and took one final step into the curtain of liquid ice.

Harry's stomach lurched as the cold water of the falls washed over him, his eyes snapping open in surprise. He stumbled backward, his hair plastered to his forehead as he emerged from the waterfall. The taste of metal filled his mouth, and his stomach heaved. His heart racing as it feels his whole body revolting against the wash of magic working on him.* "I'm okay," he assured Brodkrat, his teeth chattering. "Just the water... it's cold," he said with a forced chuckle, trying to lighten the mood. His eyes searched the goblin's face for any sign of understanding or empathy, but found only scrutiny. Harry took a deep breath and straightened up, pushing the unpleasant sensation aside. "Now, can we proceed?"

"Pretended-mister-Harry-Potter'," Brodkrat said, a hint of bemusement in his gruff voice. " For Metamorphmagus, this little bath  have  quite the dramatic effect. It doesn't help your case to hide such a things," he mused, watching Harry closely. "But, since you didn't try to look like someone else, apart for the obvious... I'll let it slide." The goblin leaned closer, his eyes gleaming in the torchlight. "You see, in our society, young ones are quite precious, rare as dragon eggs. Any harm to a goblin child, and the perpetrator would be thrown to the dragons," he said, his tone serious. "So, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. But remember, the Falls of Thief are not to be trifled with. Now, let's proceed to the procedure," Brodkrat said, gesturing toward the corridor to go back in his desk*

"Metamorphomagus?" Harry echoed, his voice trembling slightly. "I don't know what you mean." He shivered, his teeth chattering not just from the cold but from the fear of being misunderstood, his eyes never leaving Brodkrat's.
He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. "But I appreciate your concern," he said, trying to keep his voice steady. "I've had quite the journey already, and I could really use a break from all this," Harry confessed, his eyes straying to the waterfall,
-"But I'll go through whatever you need me to," Harry said with a firm nod, his voice a unsteady as his own body still revolting against himself feeling the magic of the waterfall.*

"Ah, so you didn't know," Brodkrat murmured, his sharp eyes studying Harry's reaction. "Interesting." He turned and led the way back to his desk, his mind racing with thoughts. Something about this one was... off.  he could see the scheme brewing under the obvious magic currently working in this one . "Let's proceed with the verification," Brodkrat said, his tone still wary.
-"You claim to be Harry Potter, yes?" *He eyed Harry as he took his seat behind his desk once more, his long fingers tapping out a pattern on the ancient wood.
-"If that is true, then you're quite the... unique case." The goblin's expression remained unreadable, but Harry could feel his skepticism like a palpable force in the room.
-"But, as a precaution, I will have to report this to my superiors," Brodkrat said. Turning to the warior he said " this one is safe but it'll take more time you can go back to you post" With a flick of his wrist, he summoned a quill and a piece of parchment, ready to begin the process.

Harry nodded, trying to keep his expression neutral. "I didn't even know I was a wizard until yesterday," he said, his voice low. "It's all been so... overwhelming." He sighed deeply, his shoulders slumping slightly.
-"But I promise you," he added, his eyes meeting Brodkrat's, "I mean no harm to Gringotts or any of its inhabitants." The goblin's quill pause on the parchment, his gaze on Harry unwavering.
-"I just want to be safe, and I thought coming here was the best way to do that," Harry continued, his eyes pleading. He didn't dare mention the Dursleys or the trouble he'd left behind, but he hoped that his honesty would suffice.

"Tricky customers indeed," Brodkrat murmured to himself as he finished writing the parchment. It hovered in the air for a moment, as if contemplating its fate, before darting off through a small opening in the wall. The goblin took out a drawer and pulled out a small silver knife and two pieces of parchment, laying them before Harry.
"You must sign these documents," he said, his voice firm. " if you are indeed Harry Potter, then they will reveal it. But beware, if you lie, the consequences will be severe." He slit the tip of his own finger with the knife, letting a drop of green blood fall onto one of the parchments. "Your turn," he said, pushing the knife and the piece of parchment towards Harry.

As the droplets start to move takings shape of goblins scripture. He handed the parchment back to Brodkrat, his eyes never leaving the goblin's.*

Brodkrat studied the parchments closely, his eyes widening as the blood swirled and formed words on the parchment. "Harriet... Jemma Potter," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. "Daughter of James and Lily Potter." He looked up at Harry, his expression unreadable. "This... is most unusual," he said slowly. "But the blood speaks truth." The goblin took out a magnifying glass and studied the parchments further. "You are the heir," he said finally, his voice steady confirming the revelation of the waterfall. "But you are not Harry Potter, you are a girl." The room felt like it was spinning around Harry as the revelation sank in, his mind racing with questions and fear.

Harry's eyes widened in shock, and her hand, still holding the knife, began to shake violently. A high-pitched scream built in her throat, echoing through the chamber like a banshee's wail. As the revelation of being a girl hit her, the weight of her new reality became too much to bear. He collapsed to the floor, the knife clattering against the cold stone.and the world grew dark around her.
